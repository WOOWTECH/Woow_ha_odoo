# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Added
- The Ingress markup family's owed Live-tier checks are run on Release 0.4.10
  (#243), and four of the five rows have a driver they did not have:
  `odoo18ce/tests/e2e_ingress_markup_live.py`, eight checks, each judged against
  an expectation that **differs** by surface -- under Ingress a root-relative
  `src` must resolve under the prefix, on the Public origin at the origin root,
  and the two sides being *equal* is the failure, which is why none of these is
  the adapter's two-surface diff. Its records are the parity plan's fourth
  evidence schema, `woow.ingress-markup/v1`, and like the other two additions it
  does not feed `conservation`. Escape judgement is `adapter.is_prefix_escape`
  and the stored-prefix shape and its redaction come from
  `e2e_collab_peer_snapshot_live`, so neither is reimplemented here.
- Results: #237's four checks `PARITY` on both surfaces, with the iframe path's
  `sandbox` attribute confirming which branch rendered; #238's three lines
  `PARITY`, including the half that matters -- `mailing.mailing.body_html`, the
  inlined field that leaves the installation, read back root-relative after a
  real save from the designer; #240's two halves `PARITY`; #239's image line
  `PARITY`; #234 `CLEAN` on both pairs with `escalate_issue_234_to_blocker:
  false`, so it stays `severity: important`.
- Three screens that were written down wrong, each corrected by a measurement
  rather than a reading of the source. #237's check 2 cannot be taken on
  `project.task.description` (`sanitize_tags=True` strips the `<head>`, so the
  value renders the plain path -- check 1's screen measured twice); its check 1
  is not on the To-do form (`project_todo`'s controller whitelists its cog items
  and filters *Version History* out); and #240's is not the user signature,
  which on this build is served by `o_field_html_mail` and renders an **empty**
  editor, leaving no text to select and so no floating toolbar. Also measured:
  `?debug=1` does **not** survive a navigation here, so it belongs on the form
  navigation itself -- without it the toolbar comes up with seven groups and no
  code view, which reads exactly like a missing button.
- What the run leaves owed, each with an issue rather than a sentence: the
  collaboration transport never delivered on either pair, so #234's `CLEAN` is
  about the save path and not a delivered peer snapshot (#265); `probe` writes
  the field it says it does not, and its constant marker made one reading a
  false `delivered` (#263); the hand-driven drivers emit no `.ambient.json`, so
  #256's accounting has a hole (#264); and two of #239's three lines are still
  unmeasured, one of them needing a fixture carrying `data-original-src` (#266).

## 0.4.10 — 2026-10-01

### Added
- A targets file may now aim at a GET-writing route only when that route's write
  **converges** — a second visit re-derives the same state and renders the same
  screen, a recompute or a re-store, never an accumulation and never a
  consumption. #225 decided the rule (being *bounded* to `odoo_parity` never made
  a write *cross-surface deterministic*: the first surface's visit can edit the
  very screen the second surface then judges), and this is it in the tree. Every
  `GET_WRITING_ROUTES` entry now carries a class beside its citation, and the
  guard reads nothing else: `CONVERGENT` keeps today's `odoo_parity` bound,
  `FIXTURE_CONSUMING` and `UNCLASSIFIED` are refused **on every database**,
  `odoo_parity` included. Because convergence makes each surface's render include
  the effect of its own write, the rule is order-independent — no ordering of the
  two surfaces is fixed, and none may become load-bearing — and `ensure_cart`,
  which leaves a non-empty cart exactly as it is, is the precedent it was read
  off.
- `/shop/payment/validate` is the one fixture-consuming route and is now refused
  everywhere rather than bounded: `website_sale/controllers/main.py:1978-1979`
  confirms the draft order into a sale and `request.website.sale_reset()` drops
  the cart, so the surface that opens it second has no cart to judge and
  `ensure_cart` would silently build a *different* order. The refusal happens
  before a browser launches — it reads the target list and no database, so there
  is nothing to wait for the login to report.
- The two routes #225 left pending were read against the criterion at the pinned
  Odoo (18.0.20260930) and **both are promoted to `CONVERGENT`**. `/shop/cart`:
  `main.py:796` has nothing left to unlink on a second visit and the first
  surface already rendered the cart without those lines, `:767`
  `sale_get_order()` moves the order onto the logged-in partner only while the
  two disagree (`website_sale/models/website.py:455-457`), and `:798` reaches
  `sale/controllers/portal.py:270`, whose `_portal_ensure_token()` stores an
  `access_token` only when the order has none
  (`portal/models/portal_mixin.py:31-33`). `/my/orders/`: the same guarded
  re-store, from `:270` and from the pager at `:199`
  (`portal/controllers/portal.py:93` and `:100`). Each route has exactly one
  branch that does **not** converge — the cart's abandoned-cart revival
  (`main.py:785-786`, which moves an abandoned order's lines and cancels it) and
  the order page's "Quotation viewed by customer" note
  (`sale/controllers/portal.py:168`, one per session) — and a query is the only
  way to reach either (`access_token`, `revive`), which `_TARGET_QUERY` refuses: a
  target may carry a view chooser and nothing else. That dependency is the
  promotion's footing, so a static test ties the two together; if the query rule
  ever widens, both entries have to be read again. A key is a prefix, so the
  promotions reach the siblings too, and what bounds those is that `open` makes a
  GET and nothing else: `/shop/cart/update` (`:803`), `/shop/cart/update_json`
  (`:838`), `/shop/cart/quantity` (`:948`), `/shop/cart/clear` (`:954`),
  `/my/orders/<id>/accept` (`sale/controllers/portal.py:279`), `/decline`
  (`:329`), `/transaction` (`:382`) and `/my/orders/reorder_modal_content`
  (`website_sale/controllers/reorder.py:38`) are each `type='json'` or
  `methods=['POST']`, and the two siblings a GET does reach — `/my/orders/page/<n>`
  and `/my/orders/<id>/document/<n>` — are the ones already recorded as writing
  nothing.
- `/shop/cart`'s promotion is load-bearing, which #225 did not know when it wrote
  that no targets file aims at either route:
  `docs/testing/evidence/2026-09-30-issue-213/targets.jsonl` aims at `/shop/cart`,
  and it is the Live check PR #229 owes. Refusing the route would have made that
  check unrunnable, so the audit is what the check now rests on.
- The 15 portal and `mail` prefixes #226 and #247 added carry no classification
  and are therefore `UNCLASSIFIED` — refused on `odoo_parity` too, where they used
  to be allowed. Nothing aims at any of them (the two targets files in the
  evidence tree name `/shop/payment` and `/shop/cart`, both convergent), reading
  them against the criterion is out of #228's scope, and over-refusing is the
  direction this guard errs in. Classifying one is a one-line promotion plus its
  citation.
- The rule is recorded where it is used: the convergence criterion, the three
  classes route-by-route with the reason for each, `ensure_cart` as the precedent
  and order-independence are stated beside `GET_WRITING_ROUTES` and in the
  adapter's module docstring; the operator's command sheet
  (`docs/testing/INGRESS_VS_PUBLIC_PARITY.md`, appendix A) says it in two lines;
  and `docs/adr/0012-sweeps-verify-on-the-test-host.md` gains a dated
  postscript recording the constraint on its write accounting, its original text
  unchanged. Guard-only; no behaviour change in the add-on and no version bump.
  Issue #228, decided on #225, parent #148.
- `open`'s write bound now covers `mail`'s remaining **16 controllers** — the
  sweep #226 stopped in front of. Of the five GET-reachable routes in them, three
  write and two are clean, and the three write the same way: in a decorator they
  share, not in their bodies. `@add_guest_to_context`
  (`mail/models/discuss/mail_guest.py:18`) updates the guest's timezone at
  `:30-33` through a raw `UPDATE mail_guest` (`:105-114`) on **every route it
  decorates**, from two cookies and no query: the `dgid` a Discuss public page
  left behind (`:136`) and a `tz` naming a zone `pytz` knows (`:90`). Nothing in
  the pinned Odoo sets `tz` itself, so the write is dormant on a browser that has
  only ever been here — but under Ingress the page is served from the Home
  Assistant origin, where another application's cookie reaches Odoo, and a cookie
  is not a bound this list can see. The list gains four prefixes, three of them
  for that decorator: `/discuss/channel/` (the attachment and image streams,
  `mail/controllers/discuss/binary.py:12` and `:35`), `/web/image` (`web`'s image
  route in all 17 of its spellings, `web/controllers/binary.py:164-182`, which
  `mail` re-exposes with a bare `@route()` at `discuss/binary.py:65` whose body is
  a plain `super()` call — the decorator is the only thing the override adds),
  `/mail/message/` (`mail/controllers/mail.py:237`) and `/mail/view` (`:182`,
  which carries no decorator and writes anyway: `_redirect_to_record` asks the
  record for its access action at `:129`/`:131`, and
  `portal/models/portal_mixin.py:68` answers a share user — which an
  `auth='public'` visitor is — with `_get_share_url()` at `:99`, whose
  `_portal_ensure_token()` stores a fresh `access_token` at `:33`). The list goes
  from 22 prefixes to 26.
- `/discuss/channel/<id>` was recorded clean by #226 and is not clean: it carries
  the same decorator (`mail/controllers/discuss/public_page.py:53`). The claim is
  corrected where it was made, and the new `/discuss/channel/` key bounds that
  page along with the two streams under it. The bodies of all three are clean, and
  that is why the decorator is the entry: they search a channel and stream an
  attachment through `ir.binary`, which has no create, write or unlink at the
  pinned Odoo, resizes in memory (`base/models/ir_binary.py:160`) and reaches an
  `ir.attachment` whose `validate_access` (`:723`) and `_to_http_stream` (`:805`)
  write nothing either.
- Read clean, so the next sweep need not read them again: the two worklet routes
  (`mail/controllers/discuss/rtc.py:111` and `discuss/voice.py:10`), which answer
  with a file read off the disk through `file_open`, reach no model at all and
  carry no decorator.
- A second reason `readonly=True` is not a write bound, and this one belongs to
  the add-on rather than to Odoo. The decorator's guard is
  `not req.env.cr.readonly`, and on this product that cursor is **not** readonly:
  `Registry.cursor(readonly=True)` returns a read-only cursor only when
  `_db_readonly` is set (`odoo/modules/registry.py:1015` and `:1028`), which needs
  a `db_replica_host` (`:166`) that cont-init never writes
  (`rootfs/etc/cont-init.d/10-odoo-config.sh:97-100`). So the guard that reads as
  a write bound on a replica holds nothing here, and nothing raises
  `ReadOnlySqlTransaction` to say so. A `readonly=True` route is not merely rolled
  back and re-run after a write (`odoo/http.py:2157-2168`) — here it was never on
  a read-only cursor at all.
- The sweep also read the two routes in `mail/controllers/mail.py` that #226
  counted as read while recording only `/mail/unfollow` out of it; both are the
  new entries above. And the stop-line now points where the decorator goes next:
  `im_livechat` applies it to 13 routes, `cloud_storage` and `website_livechat` to
  one each, and `im_livechat` is an installed module — so the next sweep reads a
  `type=`/`methods=` line per route rather than 13 bodies, because the write is
  already read. Guard-only; no behaviour change and no version bump.
- `odoo18ce/tests/e2e_collab_peer_snapshot_live.py`, the two-session Live-tier
  run #243 needs for that row and the first script here that opens two sessions
  on one record: session A types an unsaved marker, session B joins and the run
  waits for that marker to arrive (the transport's own evidence, since nothing
  stored it), B saves, and `project.task.description` is read back with every
  prefix in it classified as the saving session's, the other session's, or one
  nobody claims. `--pair ingress-public` is the pair that can produce a foreign
  prefix on this host. **It has not been run** -- this Iteration was told not to
  deploy and not to take the measurement -- and no token can reach its output:
  every value passes through a redaction that puts a session's label where its
  prefix was. Its pure parts are tested at the Static tier
  (`tests/test_e2e_collab_peer_snapshot.py`), including that the prefix shape it
  looks for is the gateway's own.
- The **Live tier** gained a driver for the Ingress checks that are an action
  rather than a screen: `tests/e2e_ingress_hand_checks.py`, with `visit`,
  `editbtn` and `todosave`. The menu/action adapter judges one screen against
  the same screen on the other surface, and three things #235 had to see are
  not that shape -- a page view whose result is a `website.track` row, a click
  that has to land in the web client, and a save whose result is in
  `project.task.description`. The driver borrows the adapter's own
  `SurfaceDriver`, so the Ingress session, the database reading and the
  `Masker` that hides credentials and origins are the ones every other record
  is written with, and it judges a **Prefix escape** with the adapter's
  `is_prefix_escape` rather than a second opinion -- a review of the first
  version caught exactly that: asking whether a request reached the Home
  Assistant origin *outside* the prefix answers "no" for the doubled prefix of
  `U-A2`, which is the shape #211 is about. `tests/test_e2e_ingress_hand_checks.py`
  pins that case and the rest of the pure parts. Live tier only: no change to
  the image and no version bump.
- **What a "read-only" Live run actually bounds is now written down**, as a dated
  postscript on `docs/adr/0012-sweeps-verify-on-the-test-host.md` (2026-10-01,
  #227), with the operational pointer in `docs/agents/live-tier.md`. A read-only
  run makes **no business writes**; it does not leave **zero rows**, and never
  has on a database with `website` installed. The target-seam guard #212 built
  bounds *navigations to routes that write by design*, and two writes sit outside
  that seam which no list keyed on a route can bound. Visitor tracking upserts a
  `website.visitor` and inserts a `website.track` row on any tracked page's GET
  (`website/models/ir_http.py:203`), gated on the template the response rendered
  rather than on the route — so every run that opens a website page makes it,
  `open` with a website target and the hand-check driver's `visit` alike, and
  only `crawl` never does. And a page writes through its own markup and
  JavaScript: the header cart link (`website_sale/views/templates.xml:13`) and
  `/shop/products/recently_viewed_update`
  (`website_sale/static/src/js/website_sale_recently_viewed.js:44`). Both carry
  page-view telemetry and no business state, which is why the guarantee is
  restated rather than withdrawn, and the 2026-10-01 #235 run had already counted
  them: 19 new `website.track` rows, one of which its `U-C5` check reads back as
  its measurement. The `GET_WRITING_ROUTES` comment now points at that postscript
  instead of carrying the only copy, and is nine lines shorter for it. Making a
  run *name* those ambient writes in its own evidence — a count delta per run —
  is the entry below (#256). Documentation and one static test: no behaviour
  change, no image change, no version bump.
- A run now **names the ambient rows it left**, in counts. The postscript above
  records two writes no targets file can bound — serving a tracked page upserts a
  `website.visitor` and inserts a `website.track` row, and a page's own markup and
  JavaScript write too — and how many rows a run left was a figure reconstructed
  on the host afterwards, which is how #235 got its 19. `crawl` and `open` now
  count both models after the login and again after the last navigation and write
  the delta beside their evidence, under the records' own name with
  `.ambient.json` for its extension (`ingress-open.jsonl` →
  `ingress-open.ambient.json`), with the run id, the surface, the subcommand and
  how many navigations the delta is over — the driver's own count of them, since
  one target can be several page views and each of those is what writes. The reading
  is a count and nothing else: no URL, no visitor identity, nothing to mask. A
  `crawl`'s figure is the interesting zero — it navigates `/odoo/action-<id>`,
  which renders no tracked page, so the postscript's claim that a crawl leaves
  nothing is measured per run instead of asserted.
- The counts are read over the session's own `search_count`, the read-only RPC the
  shared layers' Live harness already uses — the adapter acquires no database
  connection and takes nothing over `ssh`. It passes through the same policy every
  other thing this driver does passes through (`Operation.COUNT_ROWS`, still a
  member of `NON_MUTATING_OPERATIONS`), and a `call_kw` POST renders no template,
  so the reading cannot add to the rows it is counting. A model this database does
  not hold, or one this user may not count, leaves its reason in the record
  instead of a zero — per model, so a reading that got one count keeps it — and
  the summary is written on the way out, so a run that failed still accounts for
  what it left.
- The figure is **accounting and not a verdict**, and three things hold it there:
  its own schema (`odoo-parity-ambient/v1`) in its own file, a `diff` that never
  reads that file and a `read_records` that refuses the schema, and the parity
  plan's §12 declaring it outside `conservation` the way `woow.peer-snapshot.v1`
  already is. Both surfaces visit the same pages, so an unequal delta is an
  ordering artefact — the visitor row the first run upserted is already there for
  the second — and judging it would raise a Blocker on the order two runs happened
  to run in. The record carries that sentence itself, beside the one saying the
  delta is net: another session writing during the run is inside it, and the
  `website.visitor` GC cron can take rows out of it, so a delta below zero is a
  vacuum and not a deletion the run made. No image change and no version bump.

### Fixed
- The markup strip that keeps the Ingress prefix out of a saved html field now
  removes **any** prefix the gateway would accept, not only the one this page
  was handed. The To-do description is a collaborative field: the collaboration
  transport ships serialised nodes -- each attribute's value byte for byte --
  and the peer that joins second is handed the first peer's whole document, so
  the sending page's prefix arrives in the receiving editable (through
  `setAttribute`, which the shim wraps and which prefixes it *again*, so the
  value carries two) and the receiving session's save is what would store it.
  `__WOOW_INGRESS_MARKUP_OUT__` now strips every occurrence of
  `__INGRESS_PATH__` **and** every match of the shape nginx's
  `$safe_ingress_path` map validates, so a prefix a value arrived with is
  removed whoever put it there. One authority for that shape: the map is where
  it is written, and a test derives both patterns from the template and refuses
  a difference. A token longer than the map accepts is left alone rather than
  cut to the bound, because a URL with bytes taken out of its middle is worse
  than the escape. No new global and no new rewrite: every save site of #210
  and #238 calls this helper, the mailing's inlined `body_html` included.
- The issue's premise was corrected on the way: the token in an Ingress path is
  the **add-on's** `ingress_token`, one persisted secret per installed add-on,
  not the user's and not the session's (the per-user session is a separate
  secret carried in the `ingress_session` cookie). So two Ingress sessions on
  one add-on edit under the same prefix and #210's strip already covered that
  pair. A prefix this page never saw comes from a reinstall or a restored
  backup minting a new token, a second add-on or a second Home Assistant on the
  same database, or **a peer on the Public origin**, which serves no shim and
  no rewrite and therefore stores what it is sent. The Ingress side cannot
  prevent that write; what this change does for it is heal the record on the
  next Ingress save. The Public origin is untouched, and `U-A6`'s probe list is
  not extended. The same reading corrects two rows of the parity plan that
  called that token a *session* token (`RC-15`, `G-07`); both keep their
  severity and their advice, because the path still carries a credential and a
  link pasted to a colleague still does not open -- what refuses it is the
  `ingress_session` cookie their browser does not have. No version bump. Issue
  #234, ADR 0004 (third 2026-10-01 postscript), parent #148.
- The `open` subcommand now **reports** the write it has been bounding. A target
  on a `GET_WRITING_ROUTES` route writes while its screen renders — Odoo edits
  the draft order on a plain GET — and since #212 that write has been held to
  `odoo_parity` and named in no record: ADR 0012's "every mutation is
  accounted" lived in the bound alone, and `_judge`'s "records written"
  comparison, the one that raises a Blocker on a cross-surface difference,
  compared "none" with "none" on both surfaces, so a real divergence in what
  the GET wrote could never fire. After such a navigation the driver now reads
  the session's draft order — the same cart reading a failed cart step takes,
  factored out so both readers share it — and puts it in the record's `writes`
  as an ordinary `{"model": "sale.order", "id", "items", "how"}` row, on both
  surfaces, so `diff` judges it exactly as it judges a cart-write difference.
  No new evidence format. The row is a *state* reading and says so: its `how`
  names the prefix and quotes `GET_WRITING_ROUTES` for the write that was read,
  because two aimable prefixes write elsewhere (`/my/orders/` stores an
  `access_token`, `/website/lang` writes the order's lines) and `writes` still
  covers `sale.order` and nothing else. A target under no listed prefix takes
  no reading at all and records exactly what it did before — the reading is
  itself a `/shop/cart` navigation, which writes, so it is bounded to
  `odoo_parity` like every other write in this driver and costs one more
  navigation per GET-writing target. A cart page that would not answer leaves
  no row and the reason on the record's `result`, rather than the silence this
  change exists to end; a reading that failed on one surface only is then a
  write difference at Blocker severity, which is the verdict a comparison that
  could not be made deserves, and the `result` beside it in the joined record
  says it was the reading and not the database that differed. A visit that left
  no draft order at all leaves no row either, for #213's reason: a row naming
  `sale.order:0` would claim a record nobody created, and "none" on both
  surfaces is what the visit actually left. Future runs only: the #163 evidence
  is not rewritten. Issue #224, parent #148.
- Reopening the **media dialog** on an existing image highlights the attachment
  it came from again, under Ingress as on the Public origin.
  `ImageSelector.isInitialMedia` compares the element's `src` — which carries the
  Ingress prefix, put there by the shim's `setAttribute` wrapper on an image the
  dialog just inserted and by `__WOOW_INGRESS_MARKUP_IN__` on one that came out
  of the record — with `attachment.image_src`, which is
  `ir.attachment._compute_image_src`'s root-relative
  `/web/image/<id>-<checksum>/<name>` delivered over `call_kw`. So it never
  matched: the grid opened with nothing selected and the file had to be found
  again. The element side now goes through `__WOOW_INGRESS_MARKUP_OUT__`, the
  same move #210 made for `/html_editor/get_image_info`'s argument — one URL
  authority, no new global, a no-op on a value with no prefix, and #234's shape
  strip for free, so an image a collaborative peer sent matches too. Two
  `sub_filter` rules for that line, because Odoo 18 ships the media dialog
  **twice** (`html_editor`'s, which a backend form opens, and the legacy
  `web_editor`'s, which `wysiwyg.js` and the website editor's snippet options
  open) and the two files are the same code with different quote characters.
  Display state only: nothing is stored either way. Issue #239, ADR 0004 (fourth
  2026-10-01 postscript), parent #148.
- The same method's **other** branch, which is the one reached for any image the
  image tools have touched, had the same defect from a different direction — and
  the `src` fix alone would not have reached it, because that branch `return`s
  first. `isInitialMedia` compares `dataset.originalSrc` with
  `attachment.image_src`, and nothing in the Runtime shim prefixes
  `data-original-src` (the markup helper's attribute test is an exact name, so it
  is not a `data-src`). What prefixes it is the **generic HTML location**: its
  rule is written for `src="/`, and `sub_filter` being a plain substring search it
  matches inside the longer attribute name `data-original-src="/…` — no
  neighbouring rule claims that position first. Odoo ships that attribute inside
  stored arch (every themed image in
  `mass_mailing_themes/views/mass_mailing_themes_templates.xml` has one), so
  markup delivered as an HTML response carries a prefixed `data-original-src`
  while the same attribute on a field value does not. One more `sub_filter`,
  which serves both dialogs because it is the single line they spell identically.
  Found by a review round, not by the issue.
- Toggling the HTML editor's **code view back off** no longer re-inserts the
  record's markup with no Ingress prefix. `HtmlField.toggleCodeView` assigns
  `this.value` straight into the editable, which is a sixth markup insertion with
  none of #210's five rules on it, so every root-relative URL in the record was
  fetched from the Home Assistant root and answered 404 — the same escape as the
  To-do form's two onboarding pictures, on the same field, reached a different
  way. One `sub_filter` on the Ingress asset location, through
  `__WOOW_INGRESS_MARKUP_IN_VALUE__`: #237's helper and not #210's plain `IN`,
  because `get value()` returns `markup(newVal)` whenever the record's value is a
  `Markup` — which it is for every html field — and `IN` returns a non-string as
  it came, so the obvious rule would have matched its pattern, changed the bytes
  and fixed nothing. A test drives that rule and shows the picture still fetched
  from the Home Assistant root. Nothing is stored by the site: what stores is
  `_commitChanges` on the next blur, where #210's rule 2 strips the prefix again,
  and the round trip is executed on those shipped bytes rather than asserted —
  including the same round trip through Odoo's *unrewritten* `updateValue`, which
  is what #210 stands between this rule and the database for. Issue #240, ADR
  0004 (fifth 2026-10-01 postscript), parent #148.
- The bound on that site is **debug mode**, not "no shipped view sets the
  option": `codeview: Boolean(odoo.debug && options.codeview)` needs both, and
  five shipped views set the option, on four fields — `res.users.signature` in
  both of `base`'s user forms, `ir.actions.act_window`'s `help` (#158's field),
  `mail.template`'s `body_html` and `hr_recruitment`'s send-mail wizard body, the
  last two through `html_mail`, a subclass of the same field. #240 and #238's postscript both said otherwise.
  The label stays `severity: minor` on what survives: a developer in debug mode
  and nobody else. One shape of that screen would also produce a false pass and is
  driven in the Static tier for it — a value whose parse yields a non-empty
  `<head>` turns `sandboxedPreview` on, the field renders through the readonly
  `HtmlViewer` (#237) and `this.editor` is undefined, so the toggle runs and this
  site is never reached.

### Changed
- ADR 0004's open list named **two** media dialog comparisons; the method behind
  the first makes three, and doing to the third what the list said would have
  broken it. `DocumentSelector.fetchAttachments` compares the element's `href` with
  `` `/web/content/${attachment.id}` ``, and that template literal begins
  `` `/web/ `` — one of the generic literal rules the Ingress asset location has
  shipped since #166. So the bundle reaches the browser with the prefix already
  spliced into the literal, the comparison is prefixed-against-prefixed, and it
  has been highlighting the right document all along; an `OUT` on the `href`
  alone would have stripped one side and left the other. Measured by serving all
  four captured excerpts through a real nginx carrying every rule of that
  location: the two document ones come back with the prefix inside the literal,
  the two image ones changed by nothing but this family's own three rules,
  because `attachment.image_src` is an ORM value and the element's reads are DOM
  reads, so no generic rule can reach either operand.
  `tests/test_ingress_media_dialog_preselect.py` (40 tests) runs that nginx
  measurement and requires its answer to equal, byte for byte, what the drivers'
  own `str.replace` produced; derives the `` `/web/ `` rule from the template
  rather than quoting it; asserts it is the **only** generic rule reaching the
  excerpt; runs the comparison in node and reads back which attachment was
  selected; executes the one-sided strip and shows it selecting nothing; and
  refuses any `sub_filter` that names the `href` read, so the rule the open list
  asked for cannot arrive later by a reader following the list. Five patterns
  measured, three rewritten; `tests/fixtures/bundles/README.md` carries the
  per-bundle counts, including `html_editor.assets_media_dialog`, the nineteenth
  bundle this family added. No version bump: the Release and the Live rerun
  belong to #243.
- The general rule this one earned, recorded in ADR 0004: a comparison is not a
  URL site with a known direction, so measure **both** operands as the browser
  receives them before teaching one about the prefix. A literal in a bundle is
  subject to every generic rule in the asset location; a DOM read to every
  generic rule in the HTML location *as well as* to the shim's wrappers; an ORM
  value to none. Both of this Iteration's surprises were that mistake in
  opposite directions — one operand assumed clean that was not, one assumed
  dirty that was not — and "nothing in the shim touches it" is not "nothing
  touches it".

## 0.4.9 — 2026-10-01

### Added
- `open`'s write bound now covers the **portal** controllers of every module the
  add-on installs, not just `website_sale` plus the one `sale` route #212 read on
  the way. `GET_WRITING_ROUTES` went from 11 prefixes to 22, each new one citing
  the write it was read from in the pinned Odoo: `/my/invoices/`,
  `/my/purchase/`, `/my/projects/` and `/my/tasks/` (the portal pager stores an
  `access_token` on the records either side of the one being viewed --
  `portal/controllers/portal.py:93`, `:100`, `portal/models/portal_mixin.py:33`
  -- and the project and task pages also token every attachment they are about to
  render, `project/controllers/portal.py:209` and `:556`),
  `/my/invoices/overdue` (which bumps the company's batch payment sequence,
  `account/models/company.py:272`), `/my/project/` and `/my/task/` (the outdated
  spellings, which redirect into the two writing pages, and `page.goto` follows a
  30x), `/mail/unfollow` (`mail/controllers/mail.py:225` unlinks a follower) and
  `/digest/` (which unsubscribes a user and sets a digest's periodicity on a
  plain GET).
- `/chat/` and `/meet/` are bounded too, and they are the first entries on that
  list that **no query rule bounds**: `mail`'s Discuss public pages create a
  `mail.guest` and a `discuss.channel.member` from a channel uuid in the path
  alone (`mail/controllers/discuss/public_page.py:96`), and create the
  `discuss.channel` itself from an unknown token (`:69`) -- with a
  `request.env.cr.commit()` on the concurrent-insert path (`:81`) that a rollback
  cannot take back. The Runtime shim already rewrites the invitation link that
  leads there (`nginx.conf.template:591`), so it is a route this product
  navigates. Every other GET write the audit deferred needs a query that
  `parse_targets` refuses; these two need nothing.
- The list's comment now records which controllers were read and **found clean**
  -- every portal list page, `/my/account` and `/my/security` (whose writes are
  POST-only), the payment result pages, the downloads, the chatter avatar and
  both rating pages -- which two are clean only on a bare GET (`/payment/pay` and
  `/my/payment_method` store an invoice token when the query names an
  `invoice_id`, `account_payment/controllers/payment.py:149`), and where the
  audit stopped, so the next one does not re-read the same routes and knows to
  start on `mail`. That stop-line first put `mail`'s unread controllers at eight
  and they are **16** -- `controllers/discuss/` is a directory of eight of its
  own, and a listing of the top level alone misses it, which is the same
  directory `/chat/` was found in. Corrected, and sized: those 16 carry 51
  `@route` declarations of which 5 are GET-reachable, all 5 carrying a
  `readonly=True` that is not a write bound. #247 holds that sweep. Guard-only;
  no behaviour change and no version bump.
- The static tier measures how much of nginx's 4096-byte configuration token
  buffer the Runtime shim's prefix script has left, and fails while there is
  still room to act. That script is one single-quoted parameter, and every
  Issue that adds a wrapper to it makes it longer: #174 recorded "~200 bytes
  short of" the buffer in a comment, later softened to "a few hundred bytes",
  and by #210 the real figure was **148**. Nothing measured it -- the next
  addition over the line would have been found by `nginx -t` failing with
  `too long parameter`, which names no budget, and an addition under the line
  would have been found by nothing at all. `tests/test_nginx_parameter_budget.py`
  now measures every quoted parameter in the template with cont-init's
  substitutions applied, holds a 64-byte reserve on the shim, says in the
  failure that the way back is to move a part of the script into a `map` of
  its own (nginx concatenates variables after parsing, so a reference costs
  only its own length), pins the limit against a real nginx, and refuses any
  comment that states the headroom in prose -- which is the shape the stale
  claims took. The two comments that carried a figure now point at the
  measurement.
- A review round found two overstatements in that measurement, both now
  corrected. The nginx it drives is the one on the **Static tier**'s PATH,
  installed from the runner's base and not from the image's, so it pins the
  constant against a real nginx without proving it is the nginx the image
  ships; a differing buffer in the image surfaces on a **Deploy**, as an
  add-on that does not start. And the budget's worst case for
  `%%CANONICAL_URL%%` was an assumption, not a bound: `public_url` is an
  add-on option, and cont-init's check reads the value's shape and never its
  length, so an origin of a legal shape but 4000 bytes long would have been
  rendered into a parameter nginx refuses -- the exact failure the budget
  exists to catch early, reported as headroom. `10-odoo-config.sh` now caps
  the **Canonical URL** at the budgeted 2048 bytes and drops an over-long
  value the way it already drops a misshapen one (a warning, and a **Runtime
  shim** that publishes nothing), and a test reads the cap out of the script
  so the two numbers cannot drift apart. That cap is the one behaviour change
  here; it needs no version bump of its own.
- The **Build tier** now reads the gateway config with the nginx the add-on
  ships. Correcting the docstring above said where the measurement stops; this
  moves the stopping point. `tests/in_image/gateway_config_loads.py` runs
  inside the image this build produced and checks three things against
  `/usr/sbin/nginx` there: that the token buffer is the size the budget assumes
  (a token at the limit parses, one byte more does not), that the shipped
  template loads for every start shape -- `public_url` set, unset, and unset
  with no LAN address -- for an empty **Generated rewrite** file and a
  populated one, and that a **Canonical URL** at the new cap still loads while
  one far over the cliff does not. Every number comes from the file that states
  it: `TOKEN_LIMIT` from the budget test, `CANONICAL_URL_MAX` from the shipped
  cont-init. So the budget's worst case for the Canonical URL is now verified
  against a real nginx rather than assumed, and a differing buffer in the
  image's nginx fails a pull request instead of a **Deploy**.
- The renderer behind both tiers exists once, in `tests/gateway_render.py`
  (stdlib only, because the probe imports it inside the image where pytest and
  PyYAML are not). `test_dual_gateway.py` renders through it, so the **Static
  tier** and the Build tier cannot measure different files.
  `tests/test_gateway_config_in_image.py` proves the probe's own logic against
  the runner's nginx -- including both ways it goes red, each injected from the
  real defect it stands for -- and pins the Build-tier step to the
  unconditional amd64 build, this build's image, and a timeout. A probe that
  silently broke would otherwise pass in the one tier nothing watches.

### Changed
- The weekly bump bot keeps `odoo18ce/odoo-deb-depends.txt` current. It reads
  `Depends` out of the same Odoo package it hashes and **merges** it into the
  committed list instead of regenerating it: the `deferred`, `dropped`,
  `alternatives` and `satisfied-by` notes are state the `.deb` cannot supply
  -- which member of an alternatives group bookworm's apt resolves is a fact
  about the base image, `python3-lxml-html-clean | python3-lxml` resolving to
  the *second* name -- and a regenerate loses them and turns the layer guard
  red three ways. A dependency the nightly **gains** is appended with a
  `deferred` note naming the bump, so layer (a) is untouched and the static
  tier stays **green**: the build jobs need it, and a red one would cost the
  bump pull request the image build ADR 0002's human merge rests on. One the
  nightly **loses** keeps its line with a `dropped` note while layer (a) still
  installs it, and goes only when (a) does not. The pull request body gains a
  section naming what was added, removed, deferred or dropped, and says so in
  one line when nothing moved. The one question the bot refuses is which
  member of an alternatives group apt resolves: a group whose recorded member
  the new spelling no longer names, or one the list records nothing of, is left
  untouched and asked about in the body, because the answer is in `apt-cache
  policy` inside the base image and not in the `.deb`. Nothing in the step can
  fail the bump either -- a failed step stops the ones after it, so an
  unreadable `Depends` or a list the merge cannot parse would cost the weekly
  bump its pull request and its image build; instead the list is left as it is
  and the body says a human is needed. The merge is a script with unit tests,
  down to a no-op against the real `Depends` of the currently pinned package,
  and tests that hold its readers equal to the guard test's. Issue #156,
  parent #153, ADR 0013 (new postscript). CI only: no change to the image and
  no version bump.
- The weekly bump bot proposes the Debian **base-image** bump in a pull
  request of its own, labelled `base-image`, instead of folding it into the
  weekly Odoo pin. The base sits below every layer of the image, so moving its
  tag rebuilds all of them -- layer (a) included, which an Odoo bump leaves
  alone -- and the Release that carries it is a full download of the whole
  image, about 700 MiB, for every host on both architectures. That is the
  download that failed twice in #153, and bundling it with the routine weekly
  bump made the routine bump cost the same. `odoo-bump.yml` now runs two
  independent paths: the Odoo path rewrites only the two `ODOO_DEB_*` lines on
  `chore/odoo-nightly-bump` as before, and the base-image path starts from a
  clean tree, rewrites only `BASE_IMAGE_TAG` on `chore/base-image-bump`, and
  says in its body what merging it costs and that it is merged quarterly or on
  a security need. Neither is auto-merged (ADR 0002, new postscript), the
  base-image pull request is rewritten in place rather than reopened, and both
  bullets go through one CHANGELOG writer that merges into whatever
  `## Unreleased` already holds. CI only: no change to the image and no
  version bump.

### Fixed
- Under Ingress, the **legacy `web_editor` editor** -- the one Email
  Marketing's mail designer runs -- now loads a record's markup under the
  Ingress prefix and stores it root-relative again. Odoo 18 ships two HTML
  editors: #210 and #237 rewrote `html_editor`, and ADR 0004's postscript had
  already noted that this editor "carries none of these expressions". That was
  literally true -- its load and save sites are different expressions, so not
  one of those eight rules fired on it -- so a mailing body's pictures and
  linked documents were fetched from the Home Assistant root and answered 404,
  and, worse, **saving a mailing under Ingress stored the Supervisor token** in
  `body_arch` and in the inlined `body_html` that goes out with the mail. Ten
  rewrites close it: six putting the prefix on where markup becomes DOM
  (`Wysiwyg.startEdition`, `OdooEditor.resetContent`, the three branches of the
  readonly iframe a *sent* mailing renders through, and the `t-out` of the
  field's own readonly template) and four taking it off where a value becomes a
  record (`getEditingValue`, mass_mailing's inlined second field, and the code
  view's two writes). All six insertions go through
  `__WOOW_INGRESS_MARKUP_IN_VALUE__`, the helper #237 added, because every value
  here is an OWL `Markup` object; no new global is published. The strip sits on
  `getEditingValue` rather than on the `record.update` beside it, because
  `updateValue` compares the editing value with the record's before writing:
  strip later and every commit looks dirty and writes the field. Three widgets
  reach this editor, and checking which found one the issue had not named --
  `account_payment_register_html`, Register Payment's installments note, whose
  own value holds no URL but whose render path is now covered; `html_legacy`,
  by contrast, has no shipped view behind it at all. The mail designer's own
  iframe is built by `document.write`, so no Runtime shim runs in it, and it
  turns out to carry none of these files -- every rewritten expression runs in
  the page's realm, which is a measurement in the fixtures' README rather than
  an assumption. Two of the ten patterns start mid-identifier because nginx
  reads a `$` in a parameter as a variable and this is jQuery-era code; a test
  proves each is really the tail of the expression it names. The Public origin
  is unchanged and `html_editor` keeps behaving exactly as #237 left it. No
  version bump. Issue #238, ADR 0004 (second 2026-10-01 postscript), parent
  #148; the Live rerun is #243's.
- Under Ingress, a **readonly html field** now renders its record's pictures
  and linked documents under the Ingress prefix, down both of the paths it has.
  #210 fixed the editable path; this is the readonly `HtmlViewer`, which ADR
  0004's postscript named as the markup site that "reaches markup twice over"
  -- `t-out="state.value"` on the plain path and `iframeTarget.innerHTML` on
  the `hasFullHtml`/`cssAssetId` one -- and it is the more common of the two: a
  field is readonly on every form the user cannot edit, on every record a
  portal shows (the project-sharing client serves the same bytes) and in the
  html field's history dialog, which mounts the same component. Every
  root-relative URL in the stored markup was resolved against the Home
  Assistant root and answered 404. Nothing was ever stored wrong and nothing is
  now: a viewer has no save, so there is no strip half here, and the value the
  component holds still carries the record's own bytes -- the prefix goes on as
  the markup is inserted. Both rewrites call one new Runtime shim helper,
  `__WOOW_INGRESS_MARKUP_IN_VALUE__`, because the value a readonly html field
  renders is an OWL `Markup` object and #210's `__WOOW_INGRESS_MARKUP_IN__`
  returns a non-string as it came -- calling it here would have been a silent
  no-op. The new helper prefixes through that one and puts the wrapper back
  through the value's own constructor, since OWL inserts a `Markup` as HTML and
  escapes anything else. One of the two rewrites is the gateway template's
  first rewrite of an **OWL template**: its pattern comes from the bytes the xml
  bundle serves rather than from the source file, because lxml re-serialises
  the template on the way (the file's double space and its space before `/>`
  are not there), it anchors on the whole `<div>` because `t-out="state.value"`
  alone also occurs in the monetary field, and its fallback is an arrow
  function because OWL rewrites a `function`'s parameter into a `ctx` lookup
  and would take the component out at compile time. The `hasFullHtml` iframe's
  `sandbox` is untouched and unaffected: the helper runs in the page's realm on
  a string. The Public origin is unchanged. No version bump. Issue #237,
  ADR 0004, parent #148.
- Under Ingress, a website page view again records the page's **Canonical
  URL**. The fix that first shipped in 0.4.6 was applied on the test host and
  changed nothing there: every Ingress page view still stored the Home
  Assistant host (`U-C5`, root cause `RC-9`), and the add-on's own Odoo log
  carried both the module's "patched" line at startup *and* its "the request's
  url could not be replaced" warning on every one of those page views. The
  replacement was the no-op, not the patch. `request.httprequest` is not the
  werkzeug request: it is `odoo.http.HTTPRequest`, which wraps one and installs
  a plain `property` for each attribute it forwards, `url` included. A plain
  `property` is a data descriptor and never reads an instance's `__dict__`, so
  the value the module wrote there was read back by nobody. It now **assigns**
  to the attribute, which the wrapper forwards to the werkzeug request behind
  it, and puts the address the browser really used back after the page view is
  recorded -- by writing it again, because a forwarded attribute has no
  deleter. A request that refuses the assignment, or accepts it and goes on
  reporting the old address, is recorded as it arrived and said so in the log,
  as before. Every pull request's in-image check now also builds the request
  Odoo itself builds in that image, has this module replace that request's URL
  and put the arrived address back, and reads the URL itself after each,
  instead of only reading the flag the patch sets: reading the flag is what
  called this green while the host was unfixed. Nothing else changes -- the stored URL is still
  built on `website.get_base_url()`, a visit that already arrives on the
  Canonical URL still stores exactly what it stored before, and **page views
  stored before this version keep the Home Assistant host**: they are not
  rewritten and not deleted. No version bump. Issue #160, parent #148.
- Under Ingress, the **"Edit this content"** link on a website page now
  carries the Ingress prefix once instead of twice. `/@/<website path>` is
  Odoo 18's route from a website page into the web client, and it is the one
  route whose tail is itself a website path rather than a URL to fetch. Odoo
  builds the link by splicing `location.pathname` -- already prefixed under
  Ingress -- into that tail, so the tail read `/@<INGRESS_PREFIX>/shop/payment`
  and the prefix went on a second time, giving
  `<INGRESS_PREFIX>/@<INGRESS_PREFIX>/shop/payment`: the web client was asked
  to open `/api/hassio_ingress/<token>/shop/payment` as a website path (the
  doubled prefix of `U-A2`, a `GAP` the #163 run recorded on `/shop/payment`).
  It was never specific to the checkout -- the button is on every website page
  whose viewer may edit it. Two rewrites on the Ingress listener's asset
  location fix it: the link is now built from the canonical path with the
  prefix put on once, at the front, which is the value every consumer of it
  needs -- the anchor, the two `window.location.replace` redirects behind
  `?enable_editor` and alt+A, and the website editor's link popover, which
  hands `window.open` a `URL` object the Runtime shim does not prefix. The
  popover's own "this link is already in backend form" check now recognises a
  prefixed `/@/` path as well, so a link that is already there is followed
  rather than reopened, exactly as on the Public origin. The Public origin
  gets neither rule. No version bump. Issue #211, parent #148.
- Under Ingress, the **To-do** form's description now shows its two
  pictures instead of two broken images. The onboarding to-do Odoo creates
  for every user carries
  `<img src="/project_todo/static/img/todo_access.png">` and one more like
  it inside `project.task.description`, the browser resolved both against
  the Home Assistant root, and Home Assistant answered 404 --
  `route_escape=2`, `http_4xx_5xx=2` and `console_error=2` on a screen that
  is clean on the Public origin (a Prefix escape, root cause `RC-1`). Those
  URLs are record content in the database, not a bundle asset, and the HTML
  editor inserts them as markup -- the one path the Runtime shim leaves
  alone on purpose, because the editor saves the same value back and a hook
  there would write the token-bearing Ingress prefix into the record. So
  the shim now publishes two markup helpers,
  `__WOOW_INGRESS_MARKUP_IN__` and `__WOOW_INGRESS_MARKUP_OUT__` (string
  functions, read-only, Ingress-only, prefixing through the same `path()`
  the `fetch`, XHR and attribute wrappers already use), and five rewrites
  on the Ingress listener's asset location call them: the prefix goes on at
  both places the editor renders a stored value -- when the field opens, and
  when the collaboration plugin resets a stale document from the server --
  comes off again on every value the field writes to the record and on the
  clone the urgent save compares against it, and comes off the `src` the
  image tools send to `/html_editor/get_image_info`, which only recognises
  an attachment from a path beginning `/web/image`. The prefix goes only on URL
  attributes inside a start tag, so prose and escaped code samples keep
  their bytes, and it comes off every occurrence in the stored string, so
  neither the editor nor a pasted image can put an Ingress URL -- token and
  all -- into a record. The value that reaches the database is the value
  the Public origin would have saved, so a to-do edited under Ingress still
  shows its pictures on both surfaces. Two consequences worth knowing: a
  URL in record HTML that was not already in normal form comes back
  percent-encoded or with a `..` segment collapsed the first time it is
  edited under Ingress (the same address, different bytes), and text that
  looks like an Ingress prefix is removed when the field is saved, because
  that prefix carries the Supervisor token. The same round trip covers
  every field the Odoo 18 HTML editor drives in the backend web client; the
  legacy `web_editor` editor behind `html_legacy` and `mass_mailing_html`
  carries none of these expressions and is unchanged, as is the readonly
  preview of an html field. The Public origin gets neither the shim nor the
  rules. No version bump. Issue #210, parent #148.

## 0.4.8 — 2026-09-30

### Fixed
- The Release build no longer reads the GitHub Actions cache, only the
  `:buildcache` on ghcr, so a layer it reports as cached is the layer the
  previous Release shipped. CI writes the Actions cache from builds that
  never publish, and on aarch64 it held a different blob for the
  stable-packages layer than the one 0.4.6 shipped; the 0.4.7 build took
  that blob, so updating to 0.4.7 on aarch64 re-sent the layer (720.9 MiB
  instead of about 380 MiB). No version bump. Issue #219, parent #153.

## 0.4.7 — 2026-09-30

### Changed
- Odoo nightly package 18.0.20260914 -> 18.0.20260930. The first Odoo
  bump on the three-layer image (0.4.6): updating downloads the Odoo
  package layer and the layers under it, about 380 MiB, and reuses the
  stable-packages layer. The `Depends` of the new package is unchanged,
  so `odoo-deb-depends.txt` stays as it is. Issue #153.

## 0.4.6 — 2026-09-30

### Changed
- Release builds keep their layer cache on **ghcr**, and the Release
  notes report the download size. The build cache used to be the GitHub
  Actions one, which is evicted after 7 days unused and LRU-evicted past
  10 GB, and which every pull request writes to; a Release that missed it
  rebuilt layers nobody had asked to change, and because a rebuild runs
  `apt-get update` and gets new bytes, every rebuilt layer arrived with a
  new digest and every host downloaded it again -- 0.4.1 to 0.4.2 re-sent
  718 MiB on aarch64 and 0 MiB on amd64, from the same Dockerfile. The
  Release build now reads and writes
  `ghcr.io/woowtech/woow-ha-odoo-<arch>:buildcache`, on the same package
  as the version images, and writes it only from `main`, so a manual
  images-only run on another ref cannot become the cache the next Release
  starts from. CI reads the same cache -- the package is public, so with
  no ghcr login and no new permission -- and still writes only to the
  Actions cache, which both sides keep reading behind the registry one so
  that the first build after this change does not start cold. The image's compression (`gzip`) and the BuildKit
  version are pinned as well, because both decide what a layer's bytes
  are: changing either is a deliberate change that rebuilds every layer,
  and the workflow says so where the pins are. Every Release also carries
  a table of what updating costs a host, per architecture, against each
  of the last three Releases, computed from the published manifests and
  so correct even when a build was skipped because the image already
  existed; over 100 MiB from the previous Release the run gets a warning.
  The table can never block a Release: if it cannot be computed the notes
  say `Download size: not computed` and the tag, the GitHub Release and
  the store sync happen as before. No version bump. Issue #155, parent
  #153.
- The image is built as three layers instead of one, so that a small
  package or an Odoo bump no longer re-sends the whole thing. One `RUN`
  used to install PostgreSQL 16, the pinned Odoo nightly `.deb`, the
  fonts and every tool together, in one ~690 MiB compressed layer;
  adding `python3-yaml` in 0.4.3 and `python3-pycryptodome` in 0.4.4
  changed that layer, so both updates downloaded all of it again, and on
  a slow link the Supervisor's pull failed twice with `unexpected EOF`.
  The Dockerfile now installs **(a)** the stable packages — PostgreSQL
  16, the fonts, the tools, and the pinned `.deb`'s own dependencies,
  listed in the new `odoo18ce/odoo-deb-depends.txt` — then **(b)** the
  Odoo `.deb` alone, with `ARG ODOO_DEB_VERSION` and `ARG
  ODOO_DEB_SHA256` declared between the two, then **(c)** the small apt
  additions. A weekly Odoo bump now re-sends about 270 MiB instead of
  about 690 MiB -- the 235 MiB package and the layers below it -- and a
  small package re-sends only those, about 33 MiB: (c) itself, the
  add-ons clone at 30.8 MiB, the rootfs overlay and the permissions
  step. Those savings hold while CI's build cache still holds layer (a):
  a build that finds it gone rebuilds the layer and the update is a full
  download again, which is why a cache that does not expire is being
  chosen separately (#153). `ARG LAYER_A_REFRESH` above (a) is the one
  deliberate way to rebuild the big layer, for a security notice about
  something it installs; a fix that lives below it, in the base image or
  beside `curl`, still arrives with a base-image bump. The rule is
  written down in
  `docs/adr/0013-small-apt-additions-go-in-the-last-apt-layer.md`, and a
  new Static-tier test freezes the Dockerfile's instruction order and
  keeps layer (a)'s package list equal to the dependency file. **The
  next update downloads the full image once**, because every layer below
  the split is built anew; the one after it is small again. The set of
  packages in the image is unchanged; what changes is which layer each
  one lands in. No version bump. Issue #154, parent #153.

### Fixed
- A website page view opened through **Ingress** now records the page's
  **Canonical URL** instead of the Home Assistant host. Odoo's visitor
  tracking stored `request.httprequest.url`, whose host under Ingress is the
  Home Assistant one -- the add-on runs Odoo with `proxy_mode` and the
  Ingress listener forwards that host as `X-Forwarded-Host`. The Supervisor
  had already removed the Ingress prefix, so the path was right and only the
  scheme and host were wrong, and no Ingress token was ever stored; but
  Website > Visitors listed addresses that cannot open the page (`U-C5`,
  root cause `RC-9`), while the same screen's Public origin rows were
  correct. The image now ships a second server-wide module,
  `woow_visitor_url`, beside `woow_base_url_guard`: Odoo loads it in every
  process, installs it in no database, and it rebuilds the stored URL on
  what `website.get_base_url()` returns -- the website's `domain` when set,
  otherwise the frozen `web.base.url` -- keeping the request's own path and
  query. A visit that already arrives on the Canonical URL stores exactly
  what it stored before, and a database with no Canonical URL yet stores the
  path and query with no host at all. **Page views stored before this
  version keep the Home Assistant host**: they are not rewritten and not
  deleted. Every pull request now also starts Odoo in the image it builds
  and fails when the patch is not applied, the in-image contract ADR 0010
  established for the Canonical URL guard. Issue #160, parent #148.

## 0.4.5 — 2026-09-29

### Added
- Documentation only: what to do when an update fails on a slow link, for
  both audiences. DOCS.md "Updates and images" gains "When an update fails
  on a slow connection": how to recognize it in the Supervisor log
  (`Could not pull image`, `unexpected EOF`, under Settings → System →
  Logs), that the add-on keeps running the old version and the data is
  untouched, that "backup before update" should be switched off before a
  retry because every failed attempt leaves another full backup behind, and
  the two ways to reach WOOWTECH — GitHub Issues on `WOOWTECH/Woow_ha_odoo`
  and `woowtech@designsmart.com.tw`. For staff, `docs/runbooks/` gains
  `SLOW_LINK_DEPLOY.md` and `slow-link-pull.sh`: the script downloads the
  Release image's blobs from ghcr with `curl -C -`, so a dropped connection
  resumes from the last byte instead of restarting the 693 MiB layer that
  makes the Supervisor's own pull never converge on a slow link. It takes a
  fresh anonymous token on every attempt, never reuses the expiring signed
  storage URL, requires a 206 for a resume, verifies the size and sha256 of
  the manifest, the config and every blob, streams a docker-archive into
  `docker load`, and only prints the `ha apps update` command once the
  loaded image ID equals the manifest's config digest — it never runs the
  update itself. The runbook is zh-TW and covers the prerequisites, the
  backup that is the only way back, the disk space, running the script from
  a pinned Release tag, verifying, updating, rolling back, and the versions
  it was validated on (Docker 28.3.3, overlay2, Supervisor 2026.09.2).
  DOCS.md does not link the runbook. CI's shellcheck step now covers the
  script. No version bump. Issue #157, parent #153.

### Changed
- Documentation only: a tab Odoo opens in the browser from Ingress — a
  survey's Test button, a link that opens a new tab, "open in new tab" — is
  now recorded as a Structural gap instead of a defect. The tab is a
  top-level page, and through Ingress every top-level page lives under the
  add-on's own address, so the tab's address carries the session token and
  opens only for the person who pressed the button. DOCS.md "What only the
  Public origin can do" gains a row saying to open the same screen on the
  Public origin and share that address; the parity plan's `U-C23` rule and
  its new `G-07` row say the same, and the Live check now records
  `STRUCTURAL` with the Public origin's path. Nothing about the tab itself
  changes: it keeps its Ingress address and keeps working for the person who
  opened it. Issue #168.

### Fixed
- Under Ingress, **Action menu > Download > PDF** on a posted invoice now
  downloads the PDF instead of losing both the file and the screen. The web
  client navigated the whole Ingress frame to
  `<HA_BASE>/account/download_invoice_documents/<id>/pdf` -- the Home
  Assistant root, no Ingress prefix -- Home Assistant answered 404, and the
  invoice form was gone with it, while the same menu item downloaded the file
  on the Public origin (`U-E4`, a Prefix escape, root cause `RC-1`). No
  `window.open` was involved: the item is a plain `ir.actions.act_url` dict
  from `account.move.get_extra_print_items`, and `ActionMenus.onItemSelected`
  runs `browser.location=item.url` for an item that carries a `url` and no
  `action`. The Runtime shim cannot intercept a write to `location`, and a
  rewrite cannot prefix a URL that arrives over RPC and so is nowhere in the
  bundle -- so the shim now publishes its own URL helper to the page as
  `__WOOW_INGRESS_URL__` (read-only, Ingress-only, the same `path()` the
  `fetch`, XHR and `window.open` wrappers already use), and two rewrites on
  the Ingress listener's asset location hand it the URL before the
  navigation: `browser.location=item.url`, and `browser.location.assign(url)`
  -- which is both the `target: self` branch of the generic
  `ir.actions.act_url` executor and, byte for byte, the `home` client action,
  so all three sites stay under the prefix. Each rewritten expression falls
  back to the raw value when the global is absent, so a page whose shim did
  not run still navigates. The Public origin gets neither the shim nor the
  rules and is unchanged; **Download > PDF without Payment**, which takes the
  `/report/...` path, worked on both surfaces before and still does. No
  version bump. Issue #174, parent #148.
- Under Ingress, the website editor's Blocks panel now shows its snippet
  thumbnails instead of 36 blank tiles. Website > Edit asked the Home
  Assistant root for every one of them --
  `<HA_BASE>/website/static/src/img/snippets_thumbs/<snippet>.svg` -- and got
  404: 36 Prefix escapes and 36 console errors per editor open, with the same
  panel loading its pictures on the Public origin (`U-D2`, root cause
  `RC-1`/`RC-12`/`RC-14`). Editing itself worked and there was no
  `AssetsLoadingError`. The editor draws each tile with an OWL template,
  `t-attf-style="background-image: url({{snippet.thumbnailSrc}});"`, and a
  `url(` inside a `style` attribute is one of the ways the Runtime shim does
  not wrap by decision (ADR 0004's 2026-09-28 postscript, #169): the website
  editor saves record content back through those same paths, so a hook there
  would write the token-bearing Ingress prefix into the database. The fix is
  one rewrite on the Ingress listener's asset location, over that exact
  template text, which puts the Ingress prefix in front of a value beginning
  `/` and leaves anything else -- a snippet with no thumbnail arrives as the
  literal `oe-thumbnail` -- as it was. It rewrites the template and **not**
  the snippet catalogue response, because the value comes back: "Save block"
  hands `thumbnailSrc` to `ir.ui.view.save_snippet`, which writes it into the
  new snippet view's arch, so prefixing the response would store a Supervisor
  token in the database and break the block on the Public origin. A custom
  block therefore still saves exactly what it saved before and shows its
  thumbnail on both surfaces. Odoo 18 serves its OWL templates inside the
  asset bundle, unminified, which is what makes the template text reachable
  from there; the text occurs once, in `web_editor.assets_wysiwyg`, and the
  bytes it was measured against are kept as a test fixture. The Public origin
  listener, the catalogue response and `save_snippet` are untouched. The
  protocol-relative limit every other prefix rule has is inherited and belongs
  to #166. One picture on the same panel is not covered and is recorded rather
  than fixed: the static `snippet_disabled.svg` shown for an undroppable
  snippet, which no rule prefixes and which the measured run did not reach.
  No version bump. Issue #170, parent #148.
- Under Ingress, sending a website form now ends on its thank-you page
  instead of a Home Assistant 404. Contact Us and a job application were sent
  -- the lead and the applicant were created -- and then the page went to
  `<HA_BASE>/contactus-thank-you` or `<HA_BASE>/job-thank-you` at the Home
  Assistant root, which answered 404: the person saw an error where the
  confirmation belonged, while the same form on the Public origin opened its
  thank-you page (`U-D6` for `shared|generic` and
  `hr_recruitment|job application`, root cause `RC-1`/`RC-10`). Every form
  built on the website form snippet carries its confirmation target as an
  attribute of the server-rendered page --
  `data-success-mode="redirect" data-success-page="/contactus-thank-you"` --
  and the form script assigns that root-relative path to the page location
  once the submit RPC answers. The Ingress HTML rules rewrote `href`, `src`,
  `action`, `data-src` and `srcset` and no other attribute, the Runtime shim
  wraps no location assignment (ADR 0004 records that as a decision, not an
  omission), and the Rewrite scan reads asset bundles and not page HTML, so
  the value reached the browser bare. The Ingress listener's generic HTML
  location now carries two more rules beside those five, for
  `data-success-page="/` and for the pre-Odoo-14 spelling
  `data-success_page="/` that the form script still falls back to when
  `data-success-mode` is absent, so a form carried over by a database upgrade
  is covered as well; the copy of that location for `/web/action/load` carries
  them too, being that location plus its own escaped-quote rules. The rules
  belong to the attribute and not to any one form or path, so they cover every
  website form on every website page, including one a user builds in the
  editor. A value that is a same-page anchor (`#thanks`) or an absolute URL is
  left exactly as it was, no JSON or JavaScript response is affected, and the
  Public origin serves the attribute byte for byte. A protocol-relative value
  (`//host/path`) is prefixed and breaks, which is the limit every such rule in
  the gateway shares and which #166 fixes for all of them at once or not at
  all; unlike the others this one is typed by a person in the editor's redirect
  field rather than written by Odoo, and the template says so. The survey's own
  form was never affected: it redirects server-side, where `proxy_redirect`
  already adds the prefix. The Static tier gains the template contract for both
  rules -- on the Ingress listener, beside the attribute group they join, and
  absent from the asset location and from the origin listener -- and the
  live-nginx HTML test now serves a form page through both sockets and checks
  every shape. The maintainer reruns `U-D6` for both forms on the test host
  after deploy. No version bump. Issue #167, parent #148.
- Under Ingress, an action's help pictures load instead of 404ing. A window
  action's `help` field is HTML kept in the database, and Odoo's own help
  carries root-relative addresses: the Surveys screen of an empty survey list
  shows four `<img src="/survey/static/src/img/survey_sample_*.png">` tiles.
  That HTML reaches the browser inside a JSON-RPC response and the web client
  inserts it as markup, so the Runtime shim -- which adds the Ingress prefix
  when a page asks for a URL through an API it wraps -- never sees it, and the
  Rewrite scan, which reads asset bundles, never sees it either. The browser
  asked the Home Assistant root for the four pictures and got 404: eight
  Prefix escapes, eight 4xx and eight console errors on each of the two survey
  menus, with the Public origin clean (`U-C12`, root cause `RC-1`/`RC-12`).
  The Ingress listener now carries an exact-match location for
  `/web/action/load`, holding every directive of the generic Ingress location
  plus escaped-quote rules for `href`, `src`, `action`, `data-src` and
  `srcset`, because inside JSON the attribute quote is escaped
  (`src=\"/survey/...`) and the generic raw-quote rules never matched a byte
  of it. Each attribute also gets an identity rule written ahead of its
  general rule, so a URL that already carries the prefix is not prefixed
  twice. Two other routes deliver the same help and are deliberately left
  alone -- `/web/action/run` and `/web/dataset/call_button/<model>/<method>` --
  because they answer with an action computed at call time, and a computed
  action carries record content in its `context` as wizard defaults: prefixing
  those would put the Supervisor token into the database the first time a user
  saved the wizard. Help reached through those two keeps escaping, which is
  the smaller harm. No other JSON response is affected and the Public origin
  is unchanged. Verified on the test host against a local build of the branch:
  with the location removed the two survey menus record 8/8/8, with it in
  place every signal is 0 and the four pictures answer 200
  (`docs/testing/evidence/2026-09-28-issue-158/`). ADR 0004 gains the
  postscript that records why this is a route-scoped rewrite and not a shim
  hook. No version bump. Issue #158, parent #148.
- Public origin: the browser keeps its `Secure`, `SameSite=Lax` session
  cookie when the web client opens its bus socket. Odoo saves the session on
  its websocket route too and answers the `101` handshake with a
  `Set-Cookie: session_id=...; HttpOnly; Path=/` of its own, without `Secure`
  and without `SameSite`. The 8069 `location = /websocket` and the whole 8072
  listener proxied that response through untouched, so the bare cookie
  replaced the one `location /` had just rewritten: after login plus one
  screen the Public cookie read `Secure=False` until the next ordinary page
  response restored it, and again after the next socket (`U-B2`, root cause
  RC-4). Cookie rewriting is a property of the surface, not of one location,
  so every location that proxies to Odoo now carries its surface's rewriting:
  on the origin listeners `proxy_cookie_flags session_id
  $woow_origin_cookie_secure httponly samesite=lax` -- the websocket
  locations, the LAN-only database lifecycle locations and `/jsonrpc` beside
  the `location /` that already had it -- and on the Ingress listener
  `proxy_cookie_path / $safe_ingress_path/` with
  `proxy_cookie_flags session_id $ingress_cookie_secure httponly
  samesite=lax`, on its websocket and asset locations as well. The
  `$woow_origin_cookie_secure` and `$ingress_cookie_secure` maps are
  unchanged and stay the only source of the `Secure` decision, so the LAN
  tier over plain http still receives a cookie without `Secure` -- marking it
  Secure there means the browser never sends it back, which reads as a login
  that bounces straight to the login page -- and Ingress over plain http is
  unaffected. The Ingress half was hardening: the parity run observed its
  attributes as expected. Odoo's own cookie behaviour is untouched. The
  Static-tier contract no longer asserts the directive as a bare substring of
  the template: it parses the template into `server` and `location` blocks,
  pins the ten locations that proxy upstream across the 8069, 8072 and 5691
  listeners -- every `proxy_pass` in the file goes to Odoo -- and fails when
  any of them lacks the rewriting of its surface. A second test checks the
  rule against two mutated copies of the template: one with a directive
  removed and one with a location added, each answered with exactly that
  location, so neither a vacuous parse nor a route added with an unfamiliar
  target passes silently. `nginx -t` over both rendered
  `public_url` shapes still passes. The maintainer reruns `U-B2` generic on
  the test host after deploy. No version bump. Issue #165, parent #148.
- Ingress: a website page whose snippet stores its background in an inline
  style -- the Contact Us parallax, a cover, any image background set in the
  editor -- now loads the picture under the prefix instead of asking the
  Home Assistant root for it. The generic HTML location already rewrote
  `url(/`, `url('/` and `url("/`, but QWeb escapes attribute values with
  markupsafe, so the page arrives as
  `style="background-image: url(&#39;/web/image/website.s_parallax_default_image&#39;)"`
  and no rule matched an entity-encoded quote: one prefix escape, one 404 and
  one console error per visit, and a blank section. Four `sub_filter` rules
  now sit beside the three, one per form the escaper can produce --
  `&#39;`, `&#34;`, `&quot;`, `&#x27;` -- each keeping the entity exactly as
  it was. The existing three are untouched, so the bare and raw-quote forms
  rewrite as before, and a `url(` that is already absolute
  (`url(https://...)`) or relative (`url(img.png)`) is still left alone.
  The rules are hand-written in the generic HTML location only: asset
  bundles carry no HTML entities, so the `/web/assets/` location is
  unchanged, and the Rewrite scan, which reads bundles, learns nothing
  about page HTML. They inherit the one limit of the three beside them --
  a plain-string `sub_filter` cannot say "root-relative but not `//`", so
  a protocol-relative `url(&#39;//cdn/x.png&#39;)` is prefixed and breaks;
  Odoo writes none, and the template comment records it. The Runtime shim is unchanged -- it never
  sees markup the server sent -- so a `style` attribute the browser builds
  (#169, #170) stays where it is. The Static-tier template contract asserts
  the four rules, and the live-nginx content-type test serves an HTML
  upstream body in every form and asserts the prefix lands inside the entity
  quotes with no double prefix. The Public origin has no such rules and is
  unchanged. No version bump. Issue #166, parent #148.
- Ingress: the Event Registration Desk's barcode error sound plays again on a
  failed scan. The desk builds it with
  `new Audio(url("/barcodes/static/src/audio/error.ogg"))`, which resolves
  against the browser origin, and the Runtime shim wrapped nothing for media,
  so under Ingress the request reached the Home Assistant root and answered
  404 — one console error, one HTTP 4xx and one prefix escape, on a screen
  whose scanner was then silent when a scan failed. The `/mail/` sound on the
  next line was never affected, because `/mail/` is one of the template's
  shipped prefix rewrites. The shim now wraps the `Audio` constructor and the
  `src` setter of `HTMLMediaElement.prototype` (`<audio>` and `<video>`) and
  of `HTMLSourceElement.prototype`, through the same `path()` helper and the
  same property-setter helper it already uses for `href`/`src`/`srcset`: an
  already prefixed, cross-origin, `blob:`, `data:` or fragment-only value is
  untouched, a `URL` object is prefixed the way `fetch` and `sendBeacon` take
  one, `new Audio()` with no argument is left alone, an absent constructor is
  left absent, and the wrapper keeps `prototype` — as the `Worker` wrapper
  does — so `new Audio(...) instanceof HTMLAudioElement` still holds. One shim change covers every media prefix at once (POS sounds,
  `/barcodes/`, any future app), where a generated rewrite would cover one
  prefix at a time, so the Rewrite scan is unchanged and `/barcodes/` stays
  `INFO`. `<track>`, `<embed>`/`<object>`, `poster`, `srcObject`,
  `HTMLSourceElement.srcset` (the responsive `<picture>` candidate list, not a
  media source) and CSS `url(...)` media have not been reported escaping and
  stay uncovered, and `U-A6`'s probe list is unchanged: the guard for the media
  wrappers is the Static-tier contract plus the Registration Desk's own crawler
  record. The wrappers live in the
  same nginx map as the injection-way hooks, the tail of the prefix script's
  closure, because that script is a few hundred bytes short of nginx's
  4096-byte parameter buffer. ADR 0004 gains a 2026-09-28 media-sources
  postscript, and a Static-tier test executes the rendered shim against a DOM
  stand-in for each case above. The Public origin gets no shim and is
  unchanged. No version bump. Issue #159, parent #148.
- Ingress: a root-relative URL sent through `navigator.sendBeacon`, opened
  as an `EventSource`, or used as an SVG `<use>` reference set through
  `setAttribute("xlink:href", ...)`, `setAttribute("href", ...)` or
  `setAttributeNS(...)` now keeps the Ingress prefix instead of reaching the
  Home Assistant root. The Runtime shim wraps each of them the way it
  already wraps `fetch`, `XMLHttpRequest.open`, `Worker` and `WebSocket`,
  through the same `path()` helper: an already prefixed, cross-origin,
  `blob:`, `data:` or fragment-only value is untouched, an absent
  `sendBeacon` or `EventSource` is left absent, and `EventSource` keeps its
  prototype and its `CONNECTING`/`OPEN`/`CLOSED` constants. The hooks live
  in an nginx map of their own, spliced into the prefix script's closure,
  because that script is a few hundred bytes short of nginx's 4096-byte
  parameter buffer.
  The shim deliberately still touches nothing that inserts HTML as markup
  (`innerHTML`, `insertAdjacentHTML`, `outerHTML`), the `style` attribute or
  the text of a dynamic `<style>` element: the HTML editor and the website
  editor save record content through those paths, so a prefix written there
  would reach the database and carry the Ingress token. A screen that hits
  one of them gets a route-scoped Literal rewrite of its own instead (#158,
  #170). ADR 0004 has a 2026-09-28 postscript with both groups, and a
  Static-tier test asserts the shim has no hook for the second one.
  The Live-tier `U-A6` audit now declares each way with its group, probes
  the covered ways through the API the shim hooks rather than through
  markup, adds a `style` attribute probe, and reports `GAP` only for a
  covered way escaping under Ingress or any way escaping on the Public
  origin; an accepted escape is recorded as `PARITY` with the ways and
  their screen issues in the notes. No version bump. Issue #169, parent
  #148.
- A `website` module installed after the add-on started now gets the
  Canonical URL as the default website's domain within five minutes,
  without a restart. The maintenance bootstrap mirrors the value once, at
  start, and only when the module is already installed; a `website` added
  later through the Apps screen kept an empty domain, so under Ingress the
  home page's canonical, `og:url`, `og:image` and `twitter:image` links
  carried the Home Assistant address. The Rewrite scan service's round now
  ends with a Canonical URL catch-up: a `psql` read per database, and the
  maintenance library through `odoo shell` only for a database whose domain
  is empty or differs. The add-on log shows the same
  `maintenance db=<name>: … website.domain=<Canonical URL>` line the start
  writes. The maintenance library now also signals the running workers
  after its commit, the way an RPC request does; without that the home
  page kept `og:url` and `og:image` on the old address until the next
  restart. Issue #164.

## 0.4.4 — 2026-09-24

### Added
- The image now carries `python3-pycryptodome`, so WOOWTECH's ECPay
  e-invoice module (`ecpay_invoice_tw` from `ecpay_odoo18`, placed in
  `/share/odoo_addons/`) can be installed. It declares `pycryptodomex` and
  imports `Cryptodome`; Odoo refused it with "External dependency
  pycryptodomex not installed". The Debian package registers as
  `pycryptodomex` and provides `Cryptodome`, so no pip install is involved.
  The PR gate now runs Odoo's own external-dependency check for it in the
  built image. Issue #141.

### Changed
- The add-on's config folder is now mapped as `app_config:rw`, the name
  Supervisor 2026.07.1 gave it, instead of the legacy `addon_config:rw`.
  Nothing moves: Supervisor binds the same host folder to `/config`
  either way, and a local build no longer logs the legacy map-type
  warning. **The add-on now requires Supervisor 2026.07.1 or later**;
  older Supervisors reject the manifest and the store cannot load the
  add-on. Supported installs update Supervisor automatically. Issue #126.

## 0.4.3 — 2026-09-23

### Added
- The add-on now checks at every start that its database manager is closed
  to the Cloudflare tunnel. Once nginx answers, it requests
  `/web/database/manager` the way the tunnel does: from its own add-on
  network address (learned from the Supervisor, never loopback, which is
  LAN tier), on port 8069, with the host of `public_url` as `Host`. It
  starts normally on `404` with `public_url` set, or on `503` without it,
  and logs one line. On any other answer — `200`, a 5xx, or none at all —
  it logs an error naming the status and the route, sends a Home Assistant
  notification, and stops the container. This replaces the nightly
  Perimeter check's outside view. ADR 0005, issue #79.
- The Rewrite scan now tells you in Home Assistant when it acts. A round
  that adds Generated rewrites creates a persistent notification naming the
  new prefixes, and a round whose generation, validation or reload failed
  creates one naming the step; a round that changes nothing, and every
  round with **Apply Generated Rewrites** off, sends nothing. Ingress
  tokens are masked, a failure repeated every five minutes replaces its own
  notification rather than stacking, and a notification that cannot be
  sent is logged without changing the round. The add-on now asks for
  `homeassistant_api`, which this needs. ADR 0005, issue #78.
- The Rewrite scan now runs by itself. A new service scans once at start,
  as soon as PostgreSQL is ready, and every five minutes after that, so an
  application installed while the add-on is running has its navigation
  prefixes rewritten within five minutes and without a restart. Every
  round is written to the add-on log: the status of each database (`ok`,
  `failed`, `no bundles`) by name, whether the scan was complete, and —
  when bundles were read — what each one contains at each level, the
  exception hits and the prefixes now in the include file, with every
  Ingress token masked. A round that fails is a warning in the log and
  nothing more: the rules already in place stay live, Odoo is untouched,
  and the next round runs five minutes later. This is the first service in
  the image that does not stop the container when it exits, because Odoo
  must start and keep running whatever the scan does. ADR 0009, issue #94.
- The Rewrite scan now applies what it finds: the navigation prefixes no
  shipped rule covers become an nginx `include` file, which is validated
  with `nginx -t` against a rendered configuration that loads the candidate
  and is moved into place and reloaded only when nginx accepts it. A page
  that navigates to an address the Ingress rules do not cover yet is
  therefore fixed on the host, without a new Release. Four refusals guard
  it: an incomplete scan is never applied, a bundle whose bytes are missing
  fails its database, an unchanged generation is neither written nor
  reloaded, and a candidate nginx refuses leaves the last good file in
  place with Odoo still running. The new option **Apply Generated
  Rewrites** (`literal_rewrite_auto`, default on) freezes application: the
  scan and its report keep running and the rules already in place stay
  live. The image gains `python3-yaml`, because the exception list that
  ADR 0005 keeps applying is YAML and the container had no reader for it.
  ADR 0008, issue #93.
- A one-shot `odoo-rewrite-scan` command in the image prints, for every
  Odoo database, the asset bundle attachments it serves with their
  checksums, a per-database status, and whether a Rewrite scan is due. It
  is the read half of the Generated rewrites in ADR 0005 and it only
  reads: nothing is applied and no nginx rule changes yet. The bundles are
  read with one `psql` query plus the filestore rather than by starting an
  Odoo registry, which is about 60× cheaper per round and was measured
  before the choice was made. ADR 0007, issue #92.
- Ingress: the Runtime shim now publishes the Canonical URL to the page as
  a read-only `window.__WOOW_CANONICAL_URL__`. Odoo 18 builds some links
  for people outside in the browser, from the address in the address bar,
  and through Ingress that is the Home Assistant host, so the link is a
  Home Assistant 404 for whoever receives it; the lock on `web.base.url`
  cannot reach those values because they never pass through the server.
  This change publishes the value only. It moves no link yet — each one is
  moved onto that base by its own exact-expression rewrite, starting with
  the Discuss invitation link. Without a Canonical URL (Ingress-only and
  the Supervisor reports no LAN address) the global is empty and nothing
  changes. The Public origin is untouched. The rule that chooses the value
  stays in `canonical_url()` in the maintenance library, which the config
  rendering now calls through `odoo-canonical-url` and the maintenance
  bootstrap still calls for `web.base.url`. ADR 0006, issue #70.

### Fixed
- A LAN address that arrives a moment after the add-on starts no longer
  costs that start its Canonical URL. Without `public_url`, the address
  came from one Supervisor read at boot, and bashio caches an empty answer
  for the life of the container, so a DHCP lease that landed a few seconds
  late left the Runtime shim with no Canonical URL and `web.base.url`
  unwritten until the next restart. The read now waits up to 30 seconds,
  two seconds apart, with bashio's cache flushed in between; the published
  port is read again only while the Supervisor request itself fails; and
  the address and port the start settles on are handed to the maintenance
  bootstrap through the container environment, so one start has one LAN
  address and one port on both sides and the bootstrap never asks the
  Supervisor on its own. When no address comes, the start takes the
  no-Canonical-URL path it always took, and the log says the add-on
  waited. With `public_url` set nothing waits. Hosts
  that never have an IPv4 address (a bridge, bond, WWAN or tun uplink, an
  unmanaged interface, IPv6-only) pay the 30 seconds once per start, and
  so does a Supervisor that cannot be asked at all: the address and the
  port share the one budget. Issue #108.
- The Rewrite scan's Home Assistant notification now covers every step of
  a round. A state file or a database scan that raised used to end the
  round with a traceback and no notification; both now notify, naming the
  step (`state`, `scan`). A failure in the writes (the candidate, the move
  into place, the state write) is reported as the `apply` step, and one
  that came after the move says that the rules on disk are the new ones,
  naming them and whether nginx loaded them, instead of claiming the
  include file is untouched; the add-on log says the same, and the
  service's own failure line no longer claims the file kept its old rules.
  And a round that added rules before nginx was up says they take effect
  when nginx starts rather than that they are live now. Issue #120.
- The start-time self-check no longer stops a correct install because the
  Supervisor answered empty once. It read the add-on's own network address
  a single time at boot, and bashio caches an empty answer for the life of
  the container, so one late Supervisor reply became a failed check, a
  notification and a stopped add-on. The read is now retried for up to
  30 seconds, two seconds apart, with bashio's cache flushed in between,
  and only once nginx is up, so the Supervisor has the whole Odoo boot to
  learn the address first (`/usr/local/lib/supervisor-read.sh`, written
  for the LAN-address reads of issue #108 to use next). The Supervisor's
  placeholder `0.0.0.0`, which it answers
  before it has seen the container on the network, counts as no answer
  too, and the check refuses it and any loopback address the way it
  refuses an empty one. An address that never comes still fails the check,
  the log says the add-on waited and, when the Supervisor refused the
  request, what it said; the empty answer is not left in the cache. On pass the service logs one line; the "waiting for nginx" line
  moved to debug. Issue #119.
- A database created through the database manager on a host with no
  Canonical URL no longer has Odoo's install default,
  `http://localhost:8070`, locked in as its `web.base.url`. The start-up
  bootstrap now leaves that value unfrozen and logs a warning, so the next
  start that has a LAN address writes the Canonical URL over it; a value
  someone set is still kept and frozen as before. Issue #89.
- Ingress: a page's Share block no longer posts the Supervisor token to
  Facebook, X or WhatsApp on a host with no Canonical URL. The rewrite
  already moved the link onto that base; it now drops the Ingress prefix
  whether or not the base exists, because the alternative was handing a
  credential to a third party in exactly the deployment shapes where it is
  easiest to end up — an uplink that is a bridge, bond, WWAN or tun device,
  an interface NetworkManager does not manage, IPv6-only networking, or a
  DHCP lease that arrives after the add-on starts. Without a Canonical URL
  the link still points at the Home Assistant host and still does not work;
  it simply carries no token. ADR 0006 amendment, issues #70 and #108.
- Ingress: the three links Odoo builds in the browser for somebody
  outside to open now carry the Canonical URL instead of the Home
  Assistant host — the Discuss channel invitation link, the base shown
  before a page's path in Website → Pages, and the address a page's Share
  block hands to Facebook, X or WhatsApp. The share block was the worst of
  the three: it posted the full Ingress URL, Supervisor token included.
  Each one is moved by its own exact-expression rewrite, measured against
  the bundles the control group serves with the parity plan's 25
  applications installed and kept as a fixture; Odoo's shared URL helper is
  left alone, because it also builds the in-Ingress addresses for images,
  attachments and RPC. Without a Canonical URL nothing changes, and the
  Public origin is untouched. ADR 0006, issue #70.
- Three Prefix escapes under Ingress found by the Literal rewrite gate
  once the parity plan's 25 applications were installed on the control
  group: eCommerce's `redirect('/shop/cart')`, the payment flow's
  `window.location='/payment/status'` and a website tour's
  `window.location.href='/contactus'`. `/shop/`, `/payment/` and
  `/contactus` are now rewritten in the Ingress asset location in the
  three quote variants. Issue #58.
- Ingress: Odoo's copy buttons (share links, Discuss invitations, copy-to-
  clipboard widgets) work again when Home Assistant is opened over plain
  http on the LAN. That page is not a secure context, so the browser hides
  `navigator.clipboard` inside the Ingress iframe and every copy button
  failed silently or with "Oops! Something went wrong". The Runtime shim
  now supplies a `writeText` backed by `document.execCommand("copy")`
  whenever `navigator.clipboard` is absent; HA over https and the Public
  origin are untouched. Issue #60.
- A database created between two add-on starts no longer takes its
  Canonical URL from the first administrator login. Odoo writes
  `web.base.url` from the request it authenticated whenever
  `web.base.url.freeze` is unset, which is the state of every database the
  database manager creates after a start; through Ingress the value it
  wrote was the Home Assistant host, so every email, share, portal and
  report link pointed at Home Assistant until the next restart. The image
  now ships a server-wide module, `woow_base_url_guard`, that Odoo loads
  into every process and installs in no database and that removes the
  guess on every surface. The maintenance bootstrap stays the only writer
  of the Canonical URL; writing the value explicitly from Settings or over
  RPC is unaffected. Issue #67.

### Changed
- The Debian base image is pinned in the Dockerfile (`ARG BASE_IMAGE_TAG`,
  composed into `FROM` with `BUILD_ARCH`) and `build.yaml` is gone.
  Supervisor had deprecated `build.yaml` and passes a modernized local
  build only `BUILD_ARCH`, so a Dockerfile that took its base from
  `BUILD_FROM` could not be built on a host any more. The tag is the same
  `bookworm-2026.08.0` for both architectures; CI, the publish action and
  the weekly `odoo-bump` now read and write that one line instead of the
  YAML file. A local build on a host no longer logs the `build.yaml`
  deprecation warning. Issue #124, part of #110.
- The two Live-tier workflows, the Perimeter check and the Literal rewrite
  gate, no longer run on the nightly schedule; both are dispatch-only. The
  add-on now does both jobs on the host itself — the start-time self-check
  for the database-manager routes, the in-container Rewrite scan for the
  Literal rewrite — and the test host that served as the control group is
  being stopped, so a scheduled run would have had nothing to run against.
  `workflow_dispatch` stays on both for whenever a control group exists
  again, and release.yml still dispatches the perimeter check after a
  Release. ADR 0005, issue #80.
- The Literal rewrite gate CLI takes `--include-file`, a copy of the
  Generated rewrite include file the host under test applied, and merges
  its rules with the template's before evaluating. A run against a host
  that applied Generated rewrites then reports 0 unregistered `FAIL`
  instead of re-reporting the prefixes the add-on already covers there.
  Issue #80.

### Testing
- The Literal rewrite gate now identifies a bundle by its URL path, from
  `/web/assets/` on, instead of its file name. Odoo serves one name under a
  website-scoped `/web/assets/1/<unique>/<name>` and an unscoped
  `/web/assets/<unique>/<name>` with different content; the gate fetched
  and scanned only the first it saw, so a navigation literal in the other
  passed unreported. Both are now scanned, saved to separate files, kept
  apart by `--from-dir`, and named apart in the report. Results of earlier
  runs are a floor, not a complete count. Issue #98.
- The PR gate now fails when the Canonical URL guard is not applied. The
  `build (amd64)` job, which every pull request runs, including the Odoo
  nightly bumps, starts `odoo shell` in the image it just built, with the
  server-wide modules the add-on renders and no database, and checks that
  `res.users.authenticate` carries `woow_base_url_guard`'s flag. It runs a
  second time without the guard in `--load` and must then report it not
  applied. Before, a nightly that moved `authenticate` merged green: the
  guard's `ImportError` does not stop Odoo, whose server-wide loader logs
  it and serves unguarded. Issue #88.
- The Canonical URL guard gate proves more than the flag. The in-image
  probe now checks the last `res.users` class in Odoo's `res_users` module
  that declares `authenticate` (the one the registry runs), not the first
  flagged one, and checks that the upstream `authenticate` the wrapper
  wrapped still takes what the wrapper forwards by position (an added
  optional parameter fits; a renamed, reordered or keyword-only one does
  not), so a nightly that redefines the method later in the module or
  changes its parameters goes red instead of shipping the guess back or
  breaking every login. `build (amd64)` has a 30-minute limit, each
  `docker run` a 300 s one, and a container that never reaches the probe
  is reported as a container failure, not as the guard missing. Issue #121.
- New static-tier contract test `test_ingress_clipboard_fallback.py`
  executes the whole Runtime shim in a node `vm` context against a DOM
  stand-in and pins the clipboard fallback: absent clipboard resolves
  through one `execCommand("copy")`, removes its textarea and hands focus
  back; a present clipboard keeps the same reference; a refused copy
  rejects. It also fails when any quoted parameter in
  `nginx.conf.template` reaches nginx's 4096-byte limit, which a missing
  local nginx used to hide. Issue #60.
- New Live-tier Literal rewrite gate, `tests/e2e_literal_rewrite_gate.py`
  (issue #58, ADR 0004). It logs in to the control group's Public origin,
  collects every asset bundle the backend, Discuss, the website and each
  installed app's landing page load, extracts every root-relative string
  literal, classifies each by how the bundle consumes it (`FAIL` whole-page
  navigation, `WARN` path comparison, `INFO` anything the Runtime shim
  intercepts) and compares the prefixes against the `sub_filter` rules in
  the Ingress asset location of `nginx.conf.template`, parsed from the
  template itself. An unlisted prefix in a whole-page navigation fails the
  run unless `rootfs/usr/local/lib/literal_rewrite_exceptions.yaml`
  records it with a reason. Ingress tokens are masked in the output.
- The pure stages (extraction, classification, nginx rule parsing,
  exception matching, evaluation) ship in the image as
  `rootfs/usr/local/lib/literal_rewrite_gate.py`, next to the maintenance
  library, so the same code can serve inside the container and out. The
  static tier pins them in `test_literal_rewrite_gate.py`, which loads the
  module from the image the way the maintenance bootstrap tests do.
  Issue #75.
- New static-tier contract test `test_workflow_triggers.py`: the Perimeter
  check and the Literal rewrite gate declare `workflow_dispatch` and no
  `schedule`. `test_literal_rewrite_gate.py` gains the effective-rules
  cases — the include file parses as bare `sub_filter` lines, merged rules
  union the quote variants per prefix, and the CLI run with
  `--include-file` reports a `FAIL` prefix the file rewrites as covered.
  Issue #80.
- New workflow `literal-rewrite-gate.yml` runs the gate on demand against
  every origin in `ODOO_PUBLIC_URLS` with the `ODOO_TEST_LOGIN` /
  `ODOO_TEST_PASSWORD` secrets, failing early with the name of any missing
  secret.
- New static-tier test `test_base_url_guard.py` drives the patched login
  path against a stand-in of Odoo's `res.users`: a `user_agent_env`
  carrying a `base_location` produces no `web.base.url` write while the
  authentication result comes back unchanged, and the same stand-in is
  shown to make the write when nothing guards it. The config-script
  contract in `test_dual_gateway.py` now also pins the
  `server_wide_modules` line and the module's directory on the rendered
  `addons_path`. Issue #67.

## 0.4.2 — 2026-09-16

### Security
- The maintenance bootstrap now writes and freezes `web.base.url` on every
  Odoo database on every start, in every install shape. Before, it only did
  so when both `public_url` and `default_db` were set; an Ingress-only
  install was unprotected, and one admin login through Ingress wrote the
  Supervisor path `/api/hassio_ingress/<token>` into `web.base.url`, from
  where the token reached every email, share link, portal link and report.
  Without `public_url` the Canonical URL is now the Home Assistant host's
  LAN address with the published 8069 port, read from the Supervisor. A
  stored value that carries an Ingress token is never kept: it is replaced
  when a Canonical URL exists and removed otherwise. Issue #57.

### Added
- The default website's `domain` is set to the Canonical URL on every
  start when the `website` module is installed, so website-generated
  absolute links match email links.
- Manifest `hassio_api: true`, needed for the LAN-address fallback. The
  default role is enough; no `hassio_role` is requested.
- `DOCS.md`: a "Canonical URL" section explaining the three shapes, the
  Supervisor permission and the Ingress-only fallback.

### Changed
- `public_url` without `default_db` is a valid configuration; the add-on
  no longer refuses to start with "default_db is required". `default_db`
  is still required for `auto_update_module` and for the one-shot
  maintenance account file, which is now kept (with a warning) until a
  start with `default_db` set consumes it.
- A failure while processing one database is logged with the database
  name and the bootstrap continues with the next one; Odoo always starts.
  Only the `bootstrap-user.json` policy violations remain fatal.

### Testing
- New static-tier module `test_maintenance_bootstrap.py` runs the full
  decision matrix (`public_url` set/unset × `default_db` set/unset ×
  stored value clean/leaked/absent × LAN address available/unavailable)
  against the pure decision functions in
  `rootfs/usr/local/lib/odoo-maintenance.py`, without Odoo or the
  Supervisor.
- The perimeter check no longer reports a bare Odoo login page as blank. It
  polls for rendered body text instead of sampling once at `domcontentloaded`,
  where a database without `website` showed only "Powered by Odoo".

## 0.4.1 — 2026-09-14

First Release produced entirely by the pipeline: the weekly bump proposed
the Odoo package, a human merged it, and the Release workflow did the rest.
No database migration: none of the installed modules changed version
upstream in this window.

### Changed
- Odoo nightly package 18.0.20260806 -> 18.0.20260914.
- Debian base image bookworm -> bookworm-2026.08.0.
- `HEALTHCHECK` uses the exec (JSON) form. Same probe, no shell; hadolint
  3.5 flags the shell form (DL3025).

### Added
- Perimeter check workflow: after each Release and daily at 05:30 Taipei, a
  GitHub runner confirms from outside that every public origin listed in the
  `ODOO_PUBLIC_URLS` repository variable keeps `/web/database/*` and the
  XML-RPC/JSON-RPC database services closed, and that its basic pages load.
- Weekly Odoo nightly bump workflow: finds the newest 18.0 nightly package
  and dated Debian base-image tag, pins them with a fresh SHA256, records
  the change here, and opens a pull request that the PR gate builds. Never
  merged automatically.

## 0.4.0 — 2026-09-10

This Release changes how the add-on is installed. Supervisor now pulls a
prebuilt image instead of building the Dockerfile on your device, so this
update downloads an image once and later updates are pulls, not rebuilds.
Your database, filestore and options are untouched.

### Changed
- `image: ghcr.io/woowtech/woow-ha-odoo-{arch}`: prebuilt images for amd64
  and aarch64, published by the Release workflow with an immutable version
  tag. No more 245 MB Odoo download and PostgreSQL install on every update,
  and a released version stays installable even after nightly.odoo.com
  drops its package.
- The manifest `watchdog` URL is replaced by a Docker `HEALTHCHECK` that
  fetches the login page through nginx on loopback every 60 s, with a
  10-minute start period so first-boot database creation and post-upgrade
  module updates are not mistaken for a hang. The Watchdog toggle on the
  add-on page keeps working; it now reads container health.
- `webui` removed: with Ingress enabled the OPEN WEB UI button opens the
  sidebar panel. Direct LAN access on port 8069 is unchanged and documented
  under "LAN access".
- The Home Assistant add-on linter is now a blocking check.

### Added
- GitHub Actions PR gate: hadolint, shellcheck, yamllint, the Home Assistant
  add-on linter, a CRLF check, the static test tier, and an amd64 image build
  on every pull request. A pull request that bumps the version also builds
  aarch64 before it can merge.
- Release bookkeeping enforced by CI: the `config.yaml` version must head the
  CHANGELOG, versions must descend, and both translation files must cover the
  option schema exactly. An `## Unreleased` section is allowed only while the
  version is unchanged.
- LGPL-3.0 `LICENSE` file, matching the licence the README has always named.
- Dependabot for GitHub Actions, weekly, grouped into one pull request.
- Release workflow: a version bump merged to `main` now builds and pushes
  `ghcr.io/woowtech/woow-ha-odoo-{amd64,aarch64}:<version>` (version tag
  only, never overwritten), creates the `v<version>` tag and a GitHub
  Release from this file's section, and asks the App Store to sync at once.
  Supervisor keeps building on-device until `image:` is added to
  `config.yaml` in a later Release.
- Image labels (`io.hass.*`, `org.opencontainers.image.*`) filled in by the
  publish workflow.
- The Home Assistant add-on linter runs on every pull request as advisory
  output. It also asks for `webui` to go (Ingress is enabled) and for
  `watchdog` to become a Docker `HEALTHCHECK`; both change runtime
  behaviour and are deferred to the 0.4.0 Release, after which the linter
  becomes blocking.

### Changed
- `config.yaml` no longer states `startup: application`, `boot: auto` and
  `panel_admin: true`; these are Supervisor defaults and the linter rejects
  restating them. Nothing changes for installed add-ons.
- The static tests are pytest modules under `odoo18ce/tests/` with one
  entrypoint, `pytest odoo18ce/tests`, replacing `test-dual-gateway.sh`.
- The Settings E2E harness no longer defaults to a real deployment; the HA
  and public URLs must be supplied through the environment.
- Dockerfile: `pipefail` for the piped downloads, `--no-install-recommends`
  on the PostgreSQL install, apt lists removed from the first layer, and the
  unused `lsb-release` package dropped. No runtime behaviour changes.

## 0.3.39 — 2026-09-08

### Changed
- Rename the add-on from `Odoo 18 CE` to `Woow Odoo 18`, matching every other
  WoowTech add-on in the store (`Woow EMQX`, `Woow Immich`, `Woow Nextcloud`,
  `Woow n8n`, …). The slug stays `odoo18ce`: Home Assistant keys an installed
  add-on by slug, so changing it would strand the running instance and its
  Odoo database behind a new identity. Supervisor picks the new name up on the
  next add-on update; no configuration or data changes.

## 0.3.38 — 2026-09-08

### Security
- Remove the add-on network bridge address `172.30.32.1` from the LAN tier.
  0.3.36 treated it as LAN so the Home Assistant host could reach Odoo directly,
  on the assumption the Cloudflare tunnel arrives from its own container
  address. On a real deployment the tunnel add-on is host-networked and arrives
  from the bridge, so it inherited the LAN tier and `/web/database/manager`
  answered `200` to the public internet. Traffic from the bridge is now off-LAN;
  anything on the host that needs the full application uses the ingress panel.

### Testing
- Assert the bridge address carries no LAN entry, so it cannot be promoted back.

## 0.3.37 — 2026-09-08

### Fixed
- Answer on the published `8072` host port. Odoo binds every listener to
  `http_interface`, which is loopback, so the gevent worker could never serve
  that port itself and it refused every LAN connection even with `workers` > 0.
  nginx now owns `8072` and the worker moves to an internal `8073`.

### Security
- The `8072` origin is behind the same source-address gate as `8069`, so the
  WebSocket worker is not exposed unfiltered to whatever can reach the host.

### Testing
- Assert nginx owns `8072`, that gevent is off it, and that both origins carry
  the deny gate.

## 0.3.36 — 2026-09-08

### Added
- Reach Odoo directly from the LAN on the published `8069` host port. The origin
  listener now classifies callers by source address — which Docker preserves on a
  published port — and serves the LAN the full application, database manager
  included, while the Cloudflare tunnel keeps its restricted tier.
- `lan_networks`: space-separated IPv4/IPv6 CIDRs that define the trusted LAN
  (default `192.168.0.0/16 10.0.0.0/8 172.16.0.0/12`). Malformed entries fail
  start-up rather than reaching the nginx `geo` block.

### Changed
- Publish `8069` and `8072` on the HA host by default. The privilege split is
  enforced by source address inside nginx, not by leaving the ports unmapped.
- Default `workers` is now `2`. The gevent WebSocket on `8072` only listens while
  Odoo runs multi-process, so a published `8072` was previously always dead.
- The 8069 origin forwards the scheme the caller actually used and only marks the
  session cookie `Secure` when that scheme is HTTPS. A `Secure` cookie is never
  returned over plain LAN http, which previously would have made a successful
  login bounce straight back to the login page.

### Security
- The Cloudflare tunnel reaches the add-on from inside the add-on network, which
  the default LAN range `172.16.0.0/12` contains. `172.30.32.0/23` and the
  add-on network's IPv6 prefix are carved out of the LAN tier explicitly so the
  tunnel can never inherit LAN privileges, and the carve-out is asserted in the
  test suite.
- IPv6 callers are denied unless an operator adds their own prefix, keeping the
  default fail-closed on a dual-stack LAN.
- With `public_url` unset, no `Host` maps to the public tier, so an off-LAN
  caller is refused instead of falling through to the LAN tier.

### Testing
- Assert the add-on network carve-out, the LAN-only gate on every database
  lifecycle route, the tier-selected RPC upstream, and the conditional cookie and
  forwarded scheme.
- Render and `nginx -t` both configurations — `public_url` set and unset — rather
  than only the configured one.

## 0.3.35 — 2026-09-03

### Fixed
- Prefix root `/web/assets/` `href` and `src` attributes only inside JSON-escaped Document Layout preview HTML on HA Ingress.
- Retry an explicitly allowlisted HA Settings control once when its direct ingress iframe is temporarily replaced by the Home Assistant authorization frame.

### Testing
- Extend the live nginx response harness to parse the rewritten preview JSON and prove its escaped asset attributes and the public response remain correct.
- Add credential-free Settings retry classification contracts for the authorization-frame condition and its approval, surface, and retry limits.

## 0.3.34 — 2026-09-03

### Fixed
- Restrict the HA Ingress runtime `<head>` shim to `text/html` upstream responses so Document Layout preview HTML embedded in JSON remains parseable, while retaining ingress JSON URL and icon rewrites.

### Testing
- Add a live nginx content-type response-filter harness covering HTML shim injection, JSON preview integrity, and JSON asset URL rewriting.

## 0.3.33 — 2026-09-03

### Fixed
- Prefix the exact SettingsViewCompiler fallback icon expression in HA Ingress assets and the encoding-independent General Settings icon path in Settings view responses.
- Open Settings once in the HA E2E flow, then reacquire only the current direct ingress frame for every dynamically discovered tab instead of repeatedly invoking the app action.
- Wait for a visible Odoo login form or an already loaded navbar so document rendering cannot be mistaken for an authenticated backend.

### Testing
- Add focused ingress-only contracts for generated module icons and explicit General Settings logos while proving the public listener is unchanged.

## 0.3.32 — 2026-09-03

### Fixed
- Normalize a cloned HA Ingress URL before Odoo Router parsing, so token-prefixed Settings routes retain their action instead of falling back to Discuss.
- Make Odoo's internal route-click predicate accept only exact token-prefixed `/odoo` path segments while rejecting lookalikes such as `/odoox`.
- Preserve fragment-only Settings links and remove the competing Settings-specific DOM click workaround.

### Testing
- Add Router contracts for prefix parsing, original-URL immutability, fragment routing, external/non-Odoo rejection, and exact path boundaries.
- Add real HA/Public Settings E2E with direct-frame reacquisition, secure diagnostics, HTTP failure capture, and dynamic discovery of current and future Settings tabs.
- Render the final nginx template and require `nginx -t` in the dual-gateway suite.

## 0.3.31 — 2026-09-02

### Fixed
- Replace the Settings CSS selector containing a single-quoted `#` inside nginx's single-quoted replacement string. The generated nginx config parsed `#` as invalid syntax and watchdog-restarted the add-on.

### Testing
- Release requires both extracted JavaScript `node --check` and fully rendered `nginx -t`; neither check alone is sufficient.

## 0.3.30 — 2026-09-02

### Fixed
- Rewrite Settings `module.imgurl` values so section icons stay under HA Ingress.
- Normalize Settings hash-tab anchors to the current tokenized `/odoo/settings#<section>` URL before browser default navigation, preventing clicks from restoring stale Discuss history.

## 0.3.29 — 2026-09-02

### Fixed
- Correct a missing closing brace in the injected ingress service-worker cleanup block. The whole early shim failed with `Unexpected token 'catch'`, disabling fetch/history/Worker/WebSocket URL rewriting and allowing native Odoo service-worker registration errors.

### Testing
- Extract and run `node --check` on the injected nginx JavaScript during gateway tests so malformed shims cannot be released again.

## 0.3.28 — 2026-09-02

### Fixed
- Support HA Ingress through both public HTTPS and VPN-direct HTTP origins. Preserve the browser-visible `X-Forwarded-Proto`, generate matching HTTP/WS or HTTPS/WSS semantics, and add/remove the session cookie `Secure` flag conditionally. VPN users opening `http://<tailscale-ip>:8123` can now retain Odoo login sessions.

## 0.3.27 — 2026-09-02

### Fixed
- Keep Odoo bus `params.serverURL` equal to `window.origin` and prefix only the SharedWorker script and WebSocket endpoint expressions. Prefixing `serverURL` triggered Odoo's cross-origin data-URL worker branch; Chromium could fail before requesting the worker bundle, producing a null `UncaughtClientError` immediately after mail initialization.

## 0.3.26 — 2026-09-02

### Fixed
- Replace the SharedWorker bundle cache-buster match containing JavaScript `${...}` syntax with a simple `websocket_worker_bundle?v=` substitution. nginx parsed the former as an invalid variable and stopped the add-on at startup.

## 0.3.25 — 2026-09-02

### Fixed
- Version the Discuss SharedWorker/Worker name and imported worker-bundle URL. Browsers keep a named SharedWorker alive across iframe/add-on reloads; reusing `odoo:websocket_shared_worker` preserved the pre-fix root `/websocket` target and emitted a null `UncaughtClientError` even after transformed assets were refreshed.

## 0.3.24 — 2026-09-02

### Fixed
- Prefix Calendar and Settings (`/calendar/*`, `/base_setup/*`) RPC literals discovered by recursive app-launcher testing.
- Rewrite module icon JSON values and responsive image `srcset` URLs so Apps icons do not escape to HA root.

### Verified
- Recursive app-launcher crawl now includes Discuss, Calendar, Dashboards, Point of Sale, Invoicing, Website, Inventory, Apps and Settings as a release-gating ingress operation.

## 0.3.23 — 2026-09-02

### Fixed
- Rewrite `{"src": "/web/assets/..."}` values returned by `/web/bundle`. Website editor injects WYSIWYG JS/CSS into a child iframe whose DOM prototypes do not inherit the parent ingress shim; unrewritten bundle JSON therefore loaded root HA URLs and raised `AssetsLoadingError`.

## 0.3.22 — 2026-09-02

### Fixed
- Unregister stale Odoo service workers whose `/odoo` scope or `/web/service-worker.js` script can keep intercepting transformed ingress assets after updates. Perform one version-scoped reload after cleanup, without touching Home Assistant's own service worker registrations or unrelated CacheStorage.

## 0.3.21 — 2026-09-02

### Fixed
- Cache-bust rewritten ingress JS/CSS references with the add-on version and mark transformed assets `no-store`. Odoo asset hashes remain unchanged when only the proxy transformation changes, so browsers otherwise retained the pre-fix bus `serverURL` bundle and continued reporting real-time loss after update.

## 0.3.20 — 2026-09-02

### Fixed
- Remove the older `/bus` literal substitutions after prefixing `busParametersService.serverURL`. Applying both mechanisms generated a double ingress token for the SharedWorker bundle, so the bundle returned 404 before it could open `/websocket`.

## 0.3.19 — 2026-09-02

### Fixed
- Prefix Odoo bus `serverURL` in the rewritten backend asset bundle. Discuss passed a root-origin `wss://<ha-host>/websocket` URL into its SharedWorker, bypassing window-level WebSocket shims and causing “Real-time connection lost” with no `/websocket` request reaching the add-on.

## 0.3.18 — 2026-09-02

### Diagnostics
- Log sent/upstream X-Frame-Options plus ingress Host and forwarded scheme without query strings, enabling live differentiation between frame denial, mixed-content headers and URL rewriting failures.

## 0.3.17 — 2026-09-02

### Fixed
- Remove Odoo backend's `X-Frame-Options: DENY` only on the HA Ingress listener. Chromium rejected the authenticated `/odoo` iframe before loading any assets, producing the broken-page icon while nginx logged only `GET /odoo 200`.

## 0.3.16 — 2026-09-02

### Fixed
- Force the documented HTTPS scheme on the HA Ingress upstream headers. Supervisor connects to the add-on over internal HTTP and may omit `X-Forwarded-Proto`; falling back to nginx `$scheme` made Odoo emit mixed-content/incorrect absolute URLs and could leave the embedded page as a browser error placeholder.

## 0.3.15 — 2026-09-02

### Fixed
- Keep portal `/my/*` counters and authenticated Website operations inside the HA ingress prefix.
- Stabilize logout/protected-route browser assertions by waiting for Odoo's lazy login form.

### Verified
- Recursive authenticated ingress journey passes: backend, Discuss, Website home, Shop, Cart, Contact, Portal and back to backend, followed by logout and protected-route redirect; zero failed requests, 5xx or console errors.

## 0.3.14 — 2026-09-02

### Fixed
- Allow the HA Ingress token root to proxy Odoo Website `/` instead of forcing every root navigation back to `/odoo`; this fixes backend-to-Website transitions and authenticated frontend pages.

### Testing
- Add an adversarial recursive browser matrix covering unauthenticated/authenticated Website, backend, shop, cart, contact, portal, logout, redirects, assets, console/network errors, DB-manager denial, APIs and navigation transitions.

## 0.3.13 — 2026-09-02

### Security
- Add a localhost JSON-RPC filter that rejects public `service: db` calls while preserving object/common API services; HA Ingress retains database service access.
- Fail the public origin closed until an HTTPS `public_url` supplies an exact Host guard and canonical scheme.
- Remove Referer from access logs and pin WOOWTECH custom addons to a reviewed commit.

## 0.3.12 — 2026-09-02

### Security
- Block public XML-RPC database services in addition to `/web/database/*`.
- Remove unused Supervisor API access and read-write backup mount.
- Enforce configured public hostname and canonical scheme at the internal Cloudflare origin.
- Remove query strings from nginx access logs to avoid leaking URL-carried tokens.
- Validate one-shot bootstrap file type, ownership, mode and password length.
- Preserve standard WebSocket static constants in the ingress shim.
- Create generated secret configuration under restrictive umask.
- Replace local PostgreSQL `trust` authentication with `peer` authentication.
- Fail clearly when `public_url`, maintenance bootstrap or module auto-update lacks a target `default_db`.

## 0.3.11 — 2026-09-02

### Fixed
- Scope root-route substitutions to `/web/assets/` responses so Odoo login hidden redirect values remain unmodified.
- Prefix authenticated HTML's inline menu/translation prefetch URLs.
- Patch Odoo router `stateToUrl` origin composition so OWL navigation remains under the Supervisor ingress token.

### Verified
- Actual rendered nginx template behind an HTTPS Supervisor-prefix simulator: login, authenticated `/odoo/discuss`, menus, translations, assets and browser console all pass with zero relevant 4xx/5xx, failed requests or console errors.

## 0.3.10 — 2026-09-02

### Fixed
- Remove broad server-side JavaScript route substitution after moving the runtime shim before Odoo assets; keeping both mechanisms double-prefixed OWL navigation. Early fetch/history/Worker shims are now the single runtime URL authority.

## 0.3.9 — 2026-09-02

### Fixed
- Inject the ingress runtime shim immediately after `<head>`, before Odoo's synchronous backend asset bundles capture browser APIs.
- Handle URL objects passed to History API and rewrite all quote variants of `/mail` and `/odoo` routes.

## 0.3.8 — 2026-09-02

### Fixed
- Rewrite Odoo login form's HTML-entity-encoded inline `this.action = '/web/login'`; this assignment bypassed both the static action attribute and some browser property interception paths.

## 0.3.7 — 2026-09-02

### Fixed
- Rewrite Odoo's computed `${serverURL}/bus/websocket_worker_bundle` path, which is not a simple quoted root literal.
- Provide a complete inert service-worker controller/registration shape so Odoo does not dereference a null controller in the embedded Ingress UI.

## 0.3.6 — 2026-09-02

### Fixed
- Keep Odoo bus SharedWorker/Worker bundle URLs inside the HA ingress prefix.
- Disable Odoo service-worker registration under Ingress because its root scope crosses the Supervisor token boundary; offline/PWA caching is unnecessary for the embedded admin UI.

## 0.3.5 — 2026-09-02

### Fixed
- Preserve relative redirect targets with named nginx regex captures and disable absolute redirects on the ingress listener.
- Rewrite Odoo root-absolute RPC/worker bundle routes (`/web`, `/websocket`, `/report`, `/mail`, `/website`) that execute outside window-level URL shims.
- Added an actual nginx + HTTPS Supervisor-prefix Playwright harness during validation, covering login and authenticated OWL startup.

## 0.3.4 — 2026-09-02

### Fixed
- Post-test user downgrade now removes both Settings (`base.group_system`) and Access Rights (`base.group_erp_manager`) privileges, leaving a normal Internal User.

## 0.3.3 — 2026-09-02

### Fixed
- Normalize duplicate HA ingress prefixes produced when Odoo's lazy asset loader combines an already rewritten `data-src` with the document base URL.
- Playwright token-prefix reproduction now renders the Odoo login form with all Odoo assets inside the ingress prefix.

## 0.3.2 — 2026-09-02

### Fixed
- Remove the empty `public_url` default; Home Assistant correctly rejects an explicitly present empty value for an optional `url?` field.

## 0.3.1 — 2026-09-02

### Added
- `public_url` option freezes Odoo `web.base.url` to the canonical Cloudflare HTTPS origin
- Secure one-shot `/config/bootstrap-user.json` maintenance hook for repeatable E2E account provisioning and post-test privilege downgrade

## 0.3.0 — 2026-09-02

### Added
- Home Assistant Ingress on port 5691, opening the Odoo backend at `/odoo`
- Dual nginx gateways for HA Ingress and the Cloudflare full public origin
- Ingress rewriting for Odoo/OWL assets, JSON-RPC, forms, redirects, cookies, history, and WebSocket
- Worker-aware `/websocket` routing (HTTP port for workers=0, gevent 8072 for workers>0)
- Focused dual-gateway regression tests

### Security
- Odoo is bound to localhost:8070 and trusts forwarded headers only from bundled nginx
- HA host mappings for 8069/8072 are disabled; cloudflared uses add-on internal DNS
- Public Cloudflare gateway blocks `/web/database/*`; HA Ingress retains database management access
- Odoo package pinned to 18.0.20260806 with SHA-256 verification

## 0.2.0 — 2026-05-25

### Changed
- Upgraded PostgreSQL 15 → 16 (aligned with Odoo 18 official image)

### Added
