"""Server-wide module: a page view records the Canonical URL.

The generated ``/data/odoo.conf`` names this module in
``server_wide_modules``, so Odoo imports it in every process -- the HTTP
workers, cron and ``odoo shell`` -- and installs it in no database. An ORM
``_inherit`` would therefore never take effect; the tracked URL is replaced
by patching the ``website.visitor`` class as this module is imported, before
any registry is built. ``woow_base_url_guard`` is the precedent and this
module keeps its shape; the two have different jobs, so they stay apart.

Importing ``website`` here is what makes the patch visible to the Build
tier's probe, and it is the cost of it: every Odoo process now has
``website``'s Python imported, whether or not any database has the module
installed. Importing is not installing -- the patched class is only reached
through a registry that has ``website`` in it -- and a build that cannot
import it at all logs one line and serves untouched rather than failing to
start.

See ``tracked_url.py`` for the decision, which is pure and covered by the
Static tier.

# the assignment, and werkzeug's ``cached_property`` -- which the wrapped
