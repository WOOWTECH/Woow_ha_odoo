"""Contracts for the media dialog's preselection comparisons (issue #239).

ADR 0004's postscript named two of them as markup-and-prefix items #210 left
open, and they are the mirror of every other rule in this family: not a markup
insertion, but a comparison that expects an *unprefixed* URL and is handed a
prefixed one. Reopening the dialog on an existing image or document link is
supposed to highlight the attachment it came from; under Ingress the grid
opened with nothing selected and the user had to find the file again.

What is pinned here, and the measurement is the interesting part:

- **Only one of the two was ever broken, and the other must not be "fixed".**
  `ImageSelector.isInitialMedia` compares the element's `src` (prefixed under
  Ingress -- the shim's `setAttribute` wrapper and
  `__WOOW_INGRESS_MARKUP_IN__` both put it there) with `attachment.image_src`
  (an ORM value, never prefixed), so it never matched. That one is rewritten.
  `DocumentSelector.fetchAttachments` compares the element's `href` with
  ``` `/web/content/${attachment.id}` ``` -- and that template literal begins
  ``` `/web/ ```, which is one of the generic literal rules the Ingress asset
  location has shipped since #166. So its left operand arrives at the browser
  **already prefixed**, the comparison is prefixed-against-prefixed, and it has
  been matching all along. Stripping the `href` alone, which is what the issue
  asked for, would have broken a working screen. The tests below execute both
  halves of that: the shipped rule is derived from the template rather than
  quoted here, and a `sub_filter` that names the `href` comparison is refused.
- **The dataset branch of `isInitialMedia` is left alone for the same kind of
  reason.** `data-original-src` is not a `data-src`: the markup helper's
  attribute test is an exact name, and the `setAttribute` wrapper's list is
  `href`/`src`/`action`/`xlink:href`, so nothing in the shim prefixes it. Its
  only writer is `loadImageInfo`, which assigns the server's own `image_src`.
  Both sides of that branch are root-relative already, and the test drives the
  shim to show it rather than asserting it in prose.
- **Both dialogs, not one.** Odoo 18 ships the media dialog twice --
  `html_editor`'s, which the backend forms open, and the legacy `web_editor`'s,
  which `wysiwyg.js` and the website editor's snippet options open. The two
  files are the same code with different quote characters, so each comparison
  is rewritten once per quote style; a rule for only the editor the issue named
  would have left the mail designer's and the website editor's dialog as it
  was.
- **The counts.** An unmatched `sub_filter` is a silent no-op, so every pattern
  -- the two rewritten and the two measured-and-left-alone -- is counted in
  bytes derived from the pinned package through Odoo's own serve path, kept
  under `fixtures/bundles/`.
- **Display state only.** Nothing here is stored either way: the comparison
  decides which tile is highlighted. So there is no `OUT`-on-save half and no
  `IN`-on-render half, and the strip is used for what it is -- the one helper
  that knows what an Ingress prefix looks like.
