"""The gateway template's quoted parameters fit nginx's token buffer.

nginx reads its configuration a token at a time into a fixed 4096-byte
buffer, so a single quoted parameter longer than that is refused at parse
time with `too long parameter`. The Runtime shim is one such parameter: the
whole prefix script is one single-quoted string in
``map $upstream_http_content_type $ingress_runtime_shim``, and every Issue
that adds a wrapper to it makes that string longer.

Nothing measured that until now. What stood in for a measurement was a
comment: the template said beside ``$ingress_url_global_shim`` that the
script was "~200 bytes short of nginx's 4096-byte parameter buffer" when
#174 wrote it, and later "a few hundred bytes short of" it, while #169,
#210 and the rest spent that margin down to 148. The only thing between
the next addition and a build that will not start was ``nginx -t`` in
``test_dual_gateway.py``, which fails with nginx's own parse error and says
nothing about a budget. Both comments now point here, and
``test_no_comment_states_the_headroom_in_prose`` keeps it that way.

So this file measures it and fails early, with the escape valve in the
message. That valve is the reason the cliff is cheap to step back from:
nginx concatenates variables into a parameter at *runtime*, after parsing,
so moving a part of the script into a ``map`` of its own costs the parameter
only the ~28 bytes of the variable reference while taking hundreds out of
it. ``$ingress_injection_hooks_shim``, ``$ingress_url_global_shim`` and
``$ingress_markup_global_shim`` are each that move already made, and each of
those maps has thousands of bytes free.

The limit is not asserted from the source of nginx: the last test drives a
real nginx with a token at the limit and a token one byte over it, so the
constant here is a measurement and cannot drift away from the nginx the
image ships.
