"""Is ``website.visitor._handle_webpage_dispatch`` patched in this Odoo? Issue #160.

The build tier pipes this file into ``odoo shell`` in the image it just
built, with no database: by then Odoo's own loader has imported the
server-wide modules the add-on configures. When ``woow_visitor_url`` cannot
find its seam, or cannot import ``website`` at all, that loader only logs it
and carries on, so asking Odoo whether the patch is on is the one check that
goes red. The probe never imports the module itself -- that would apply the
patch and pass by itself.

What the flag alone would not prove -- the two things ADR 0010's amendment
named for the Canonical URL guard (issue #121), and the one the reopened #160
adds:

* the class the module patched is the last one in ``website_visitor``
  declaring ``_handle_webpage_dispatch``. Odoo builds a model from every
  class declaring its ``_name``, later declarations overriding earlier ones,
  so within that module the last declaration is the one the registry runs.
  Overrides in other modules are not read here: the tracked URL is built in
  ``website_visitor``, and an override elsewhere reaches it through
  ``super()``;
* the wrapper still fits upstream. ``functools.wraps`` keeps the original
  under ``__wrapped__``; if a nightly changed its parameters the patch still
  installs and every tracked page view raises ``TypeError``;
* the url replacement the patch performs takes on the request Odoo builds.
  This is the half issue #160 was reopened over: the flag was on the host and
  every Ingress page view still recorded the Home Assistant host, because
  ``odoo.http.HTTPRequest`` forwards ``url`` through a plain ``property`` that
  never reads the instance ``__dict__``. A flag cannot see that; building this
  image's own ``request`` and having the module replace the url on it can.

Prints one of ``visitor-url: applied``, ``visitor-url: not applied``,
``visitor-url: signature mismatch (...)``, ``visitor-url: url not replaceable
(...)`` or ``visitor-url: url swap unprovable (...)``. Exit status 0 only for
the first.

    The verdict tells apart the two ways this can fail, because they mean
    different things to whoever reads the build:

    * ``"url swap unprovable"`` -- the replacement could not be performed. This
      Odoo's ``odoo.http`` no longer has what the probe reads, its request
      cannot be built over a bare environ, its url cannot be read, or the
      module's own function is not where this reads it. A nightly changed a
      shape; nothing is known about the patch.

      so a page view would record the address the request arrived on. This is
      the 0.4.6 defect, and the half issue #160 was reopened over.

    ``http`` is Odoo's ``odoo.http``. What the dispatch reads is
    ``request.httprequest``, an ``odoo.http.HTTPRequest``: a wrapper that
    installs one plain ``property`` per forwarded attribute, ``url`` included,
    whose getter and setter reach the werkzeug request it wraps
    (``make_request_wrap_methods``). The module replaces that attribute, so
    this builds the request over a bare environ, hands it to the module's own
    replacement, and reads the url back itself -- a function that reported
    success without changing anything would not get past the reading.

    What it does not read is Odoo's WSGI application putting that wrapper on
    the request in the first place. If a nightly interposes something else
    there, this stays green and the module's own read-back guard catches it at
    runtime -- a warning per page view, which is what the host logged on 0.4.6.
