"""Contracts for the Ingress action-help rewrite (issue #158).

A window action's ``help`` field is HTML kept in the database, and Odoo's own
help carries root-relative attributes: the Surveys screen of an empty list
(``ir.actions.act_window`` 930) shows four
``<img src="/survey/static/src/img/survey_sample_*.png">`` tiles. The web
client reads that field out of the ``/web/action/load`` JSON-RPC response,
hands it to ``markup()``, and inserts it as markup -- so the Runtime shim,
which wraps APIs and not ``innerHTML``, never sees the URL. Under Ingress the
browser asked the Home Assistant root for the four pictures and got 404: eight
**Prefix escapes** per screen.

ADR 0004's 2026-09-28 postscript decides markup insertion stays *uncovered* by
the shim -- the HTML editor saves record content back through the same path, so
a hook would write the token-bearing Ingress prefix into the database -- and
sends a screen that hits it to a route-scoped **Literal rewrite** instead. That
is what these contracts guard:

* the two routes that hand the web client an action dict, ``/web/action/load``
  and ``/web/action/run``, each get an exact-match ``location`` of their own,
  so no other JSON response sees the rules (ADR 0004's second rejected option,
  and the reason 0.3.34 had to stop rewriting JSON wholesale);
* each of those locations is otherwise the Ingress ``location /`` -- proxy
  headers, cookie path and flags, ``X-Frame-Options`` removal, buffering,
  timeouts and every rule it carries. The comparison is by directive, so drift
  in either body fails here rather than quietly changing the route;
* the rules run, over the real template's directives, against a live nginx: an
  escaped-quote attribute URL is prefixed, one that already carries the prefix
  is left alone, and the generic location on the same listener still does not
  touch either.
