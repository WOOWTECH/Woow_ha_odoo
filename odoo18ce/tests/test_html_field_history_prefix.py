"""Which write puts an Ingress prefix in an html field's history (`G-10`, #296).

#282's mutating Live run opened the Version History dialog of
`project.task(5).description` on both surfaces. The field itself was `CLEAN`
-- 0 prefixes, a state-bounding reading (#289) -- and on the **Public** origin
the dialog nevertheless drew both onboarding pictures as
`/api/hassio_ingress/<token>/project_todo/static/img/…`, `loaded: false`,
verdict `ESCAPED`. The Public origin has no shim and no rewrite (ADR 0003), so
the prefix can only have come out of the stored history. Registered as `G-10`
in section 11 of the parity plan.

The first reading of it got the author backwards, and this file is where the
corrected one is executed rather than argued. `html.field.history.mixin.write`
stores `generate_patch(new_content, old_content)`, and `_patch_generator`
embeds `old_content_lines` -- the patch that `apply_patch` walks the *current*
value **backwards** with. A revision therefore carries the value as it was
*before* its own write, which inverts everything that follows from it:

- the Public peer's save, which puts the prefix in the field (`G-08`), records
  a **clean** revision, because the value it replaced was clean;
- the next Ingress save, the one #234's strip makes clean and which *heals*
  the field, is the write that deposits the **prefixed** revision.

So the residue is written by the heal, it recurs once per `G-08` store-and-heal
cycle rather than being one historical accident, and it is bounded rather than
permanent: `_html_field_history_size_limit = 300` evicts it once 300 further
revisions exist on that field. None of that moves `G-08`'s severity -- a
prefixed live field indefinitely is worse than a clean field plus one ageing
history entry -- and #234's standing sentence is amended, not re-graded.

What is pinned here:

- **The direction, driven.** `generate_patch` and `apply_patch` are pure
  (`diff_utils` imports only `re` and `difflib`), so the captured module is
  loaded by path and run: the store patch carries no prefix, the heal patch
  carries both pictures, and `apply_patch` reconstructs a prefixed document
  from the clean value the field holds today. That last line is what the
  dialog does, and why `ESCAPED` is a faithful reading.
- **The measured document, not an invented one.** The input is
  `project.task(5).description` byte-for-byte as #282's `markup.jsonl`
  recorded it, and a test holds the fixture to that record.
- **The host's revision shape, replayed offline.** Two store-and-heal pairs
  leave the prefix in the *second* revision of each pair -- revisions 13 and
  16 of 17 on the host, each heal some 30 s after its store.
- **The source shape the direction rests on**, with `ast` rather than text, so
  a comment cannot satisfy it: the pre-write capture happens before
  `super().write(vals)`, `generate_patch` is called new-then-old,
  `_patch_generator` appends only `old_content_lines`, and the reconstruction
  starts from the current field value.
- **That the history is not writable through an ordinary write.** `create`
  and `write` both drop `html_field_history` out of the incoming vals, so any
  correction of the two existing revisions would need `super()` or raw SQL.
  #296 decided against one: editing the store a reading comes from is the move
  ADR 0014 refuses a stored-prefix valve under, with fewer witnesses. The two
  revisions on the host are left untouched.

Nothing here is a fix, because there is no admissible Ingress-side fix: the
prefixed value is in the field the moment the Public peer saves it, and ADR
0003 keeps that surface unchanged. What the add-on's code decides is only
whether the field stays prefixed too.
