"""Live: the Ingress markup family's four readonly/editor screens (#243).

`#243` is the register of Live-tier checks the Ingress markup family left owed.
Four of its five rows have no adapter subcommand, because none of them is the
shape `e2e_menu_action_adapter.py` judges -- "open this screen on both surfaces
and diff the two records". Each is instead *one interaction* whose result is
read in two places: on the screen (did the picture resolve under the prefix and
arrive) and in the database afterwards (is the stored value still
root-relative). The fifth row, #234's, is `e2e_collab_peer_snapshot_live.py`,
whose pure helpers this module reuses rather than copies.

    readonly-plain      #237 check 1. A readonly html field on the plain path
                        (`t-out="state.value"`): the html field's history
                        dialog, which mounts `HtmlViewer` through a `getConfig()`
                        setting neither `hasFullHtml` nor `cssAssetId`, so it is
                        that path by construction. Reads only.
    readonly-iframe     #237 check 2. The same field on the `hasFullHtml` path,
                        inside `sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-popups
                        allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox"`. Needs a full-HTML
                        value, so it seeds a **scratch** task -- never the
                        onboarding to-do, whose stored `src` #235's checks read.
    codeview            #240. A user signature in Preferences with debug mode
                        on: the code view toggled off re-inserts the record's
                        markup, and the save must still store it root-relative.
    media-image-todo    #239 line 1. The media dialog reopened on an existing
                        image in a To-do description. It builds a scratch to-do
                        and its image: #243's pass here came from a hand-made
                        attachment that was cleaned up afterwards, and the
                        onboarding to-do's own picture is a static module asset
                        no dialog can list (#266).
    media-image-website #239 line 2, the more informative one: the same dialog
                        in the website editor, where `data-original-src` arrives
                        prefixed by the *generic HTML location* rather than the
                        shim, which is the branch that `return`s before the
                        first rule. It **builds its own page**, because #243's
                        run found nothing on this host for that branch to
                        execute on and therefore measured nothing (#266).
    media-document-todo #239 line 3 on the **current** editor, where it is
                        unreachable: Replace is namespaced to `image` and a
                        document is an `a.o_image`, so no control reopens the
                        dialog. Kept, because "no control reached it" is the
                        reading, and the premise is measured another way. It
                        builds a scratch to-do and a document so that the
                        unreachability is a reading rather than an absence
                        (#266).
    media-document-mailing
                        #239 line 3 on the **legacy** editor, which does have
                        one. A no-change check: the document tile was never
                        broken, because both operands of its comparison arrive
                        prefixed. Not highlighted here is new information, not
                        a partial fix. It builds its own document, and it
                        measures `#media-replace` as well as the tile, because
                        the toolbar is hidden outright for a media carrying a
                        non-image `data-mimetype` -- which the dialog's own
                        `createElements` always stamps on a document (#266).
                        It builds its **mailing** as well when the database
                        carries no draft or queued one -- `odoo_parity` happens
                        to, and a fresh install does not (#274).
    mailing-readonly    #238 line 3. A *sent* mailing's body: the legacy
                        editor's readonly iframe. Reads only, so it runs first.
    mailing-editable    #238 lines 1 and 2. The mail designer, and the two
                        fields a save writes -- `body_arch` through
                        `getEditingValue`, and `body_html`, which
                        `commitChanges` inlines separately and which is the one
                        that **leaves the installation**. A run that reads back
                        only `body_arch` has measured half the fix. It **builds
                        its own mailing and borrows nothing** unless
                        `--mailing-id` names one (#276): this is the check that
                        *saves*, so a borrowed row kept this run's marker body
                        in both of those fields if the run was killed before the
                        restore or taken without the optional `--cleanup`.

Three judgements are deliberately **not** reimplemented here, because each has
a shape that would make a wrong record look clean:

- **Prefix escape is `adapter.is_prefix_escape`.** The shape a local version
  loses is the doubled prefix: still *under* the prefix, so "did it leave the
  prefix" answers no. `e2e_ingress_hand_checks.py` carries the same note
  because a review caught exactly that there, and every rule in this family
  prefixes a value that may already carry one.
- **A picture's verdict depends on the surface.** Under Ingress a root-relative
  `src` must resolve under the prefix; on the Public origin it must resolve at
  the origin root, and a prefix appearing there at all is a `sub_filter` that
  leaked out of the Ingress asset location (#237 check 3). The surface is a
  parameter, never a constant.
- **An Ingress prefix in a stored value is `e2e_collab_peer_snapshot_live`'s
  shape**, which is derived from the gateway's own `$safe_ingress_path` map and
  pinned against the template. A second regex here would drift away from the
  add-on with nothing noticing. Its `redact` comes with it, so no Supervisor
  token reaches a record even though what every check reads back is *which*
  prefix is in a value.

The pure parts are tested in `test_e2e_ingress_markup_live.py`. **The browser
steps are not**, the way `e2e_collab_peer_snapshot_live.py` says of its own:
they have never been executed against this host. Run the read-only checks first
(`read_only_first`) so a selector that moved costs nothing.

Writing: `readonly-iframe` creates one scratch `mail.template` and deletes it on
`--cleanup`; `codeview` writes one `ir.actions.act_window.help`;
`mailing-editable` **creates its own draft mailing** (#276, reclaiming a scratch
one an earlier surface or run left) and writes that mailing's `body_arch` and
`body_html`, deleted under `--cleanup`, and borrows a real campaign only when
`--mailing-id` names one -- in which case both fields are written back instead;
`media-image-website` creates one public image `ir.attachment` and one
`website.page` whose arch carries that attachment's own `image_src` in **both**
`src` and `data-original-src`; `media-document-mailing` creates one public
document `ir.attachment`, writes one mailing's `body_arch`, and **creates that
mailing** when the database has no draft or queued one (#274) -- deleted under
`--cleanup`, as is a scratch mailing an earlier surface or run left behind,
while a mailing it borrowed instead has both fields written back and is never
deleted;
`media-document-todo` and `media-image-todo` each create one public
`ir.attachment` and one scratch `project.task` holding the element that came
from it. **All four media checks build everything they measure** (#266, #274),
because none of them could measure anything on this database otherwise: #243's
run made its image and document fixtures by hand and cleaned them up, and the
only things left on the record are a static module asset and a website logo,
which no dialog lists. `mailing-editable` builds its mailing for the other half
of the same rule (#276): it measures a **save**, so the record it saves over must
not be somebody's campaign. `--cleanup` removes all five. A *reclaimed*
mailing's own litter goes with the reclaim instead, whatever the flag says: the
public attachment an earlier run's body links is in no fixture dict the
reclaiming run holds, and the seeding replaces the href that names it, so the
ids are read and unlinked as the row is taken over (#277). Each marker names its
run, so a later reader can tell whose text it is. Every other check reads only. The
boundary is ADR 0012.

**The ambient rows a run leaves are counted by the run** (#256, #264): each
surface counts `website.track` and `website.visitor` over its own session's RPC
after the login and again on the way out, and the delta is appended beside the
records under their own name with `.ambient.json` for its extension
(`markup.jsonl` -> `markup.ambient.json`) -- one line per surface per
invocation, because the records append the same way. Counts only, no URL and no
visitor identity. `media-image-website` is why this driver needs the figure:
it opens the website editor, whose preview iframes load tracked website pages,
so those rows are certainly written -- #243's evidence had to read an absolute
count on the host afterwards and say that no delta could be stated. The
denominator is every document GET the session's browser context made under its
base, which is the only way to count a navigation the editor made for itself.
It is accounting and not a verdict: `diff` never reads it, `read_records`
refuses its schema, and the conservation tally does not move for it.

# A different question from what the value says, and the one the record could not
# answer. A **Write-bounding reading** is on a field the check itself wrote, so a
# prefix in it is that check's own save leaking. A **State-bounding reading** is
# on a field it did not, so a prefix is a leak whoever caused it and the check is
# the witness rather than the author (`CONTEXT.md` carries both terms). Five of
# this driver's read-back sites take the second kind -- `readonly-plain`,
# `mailing-readonly` (both its fields), `media-document-mailing`'s `body_html`,
# `readonly-iframe` under `--task-id` and `mailing-editable`'s `body_html` under
# `--mailing-id` -- and all five were reported identically to the first, as a
# `PREFIX-STORED` attributed to the check and surface that merely looked.
#
# **Both kinds are still reported and both still fail the run.** ADR 0014 refuses
# a per-field valve that withholds a verdict, and a per-check "judge but do not
# fail" policy is that same valve one layer out: the finding would still vanish
# from the exit code, the tally and the sweep gate. What the kind changes is the
# *claim* -- a check whose register row says `writes: False` was being printed as
# the author of a write, which on the Public origin is the leaked-`sub_filter`
# finding and a more serious statement than "this row has held a prefix since
# before the run".
#
# **Not composed into the verdict string**, which is where this differs from the
# peer snapshot driver's `classify`. There the kind *is* the verdict:
# `OWN-`/`FOREIGN-`/`UNKNOWN-PREFIX-STORED` are three findings with a severity
# order between them. Here the kind moves no verdict, so folding it into the

# #243's run reached both of the lines below and measured neither, and the
# reason was the same both times: **the host carries nothing either branch can
# execute on.** The website home page's only visible image is
# `/web/image/website/1/logo/My%20Website`, a record-field image whose
# `data-original-src` is `None`, so rule 2's `if (…dataset.originalSrc)` never
# runs. And the only `data-original-src` Odoo ships in stored arch is
# `mass_mailing_themes`' seven themed images -- whose `data-original-id` values
# (435, 436, 437, 347) are ids from the developer's own database, whose paths
# match no `ir.attachment` here, and which reach the designer over
# `render_public_asset`, root-relative. They could never highlight a tile and
# never arrive prefixed, so they are not the screen either.
#
# So these two checks build what they measure. Each fixture is one public
# `ir.attachment` plus one record, both named after the run and both removed by
# `--cleanup`.
#
# A 1x1 PNG, the smallest thing that is still a real `image/png` -- which is
# what the dialog's `['mimetype', 'in', IMAGE_MIMETYPES]` clause asks of it
# (`web_editor/.../image_selector.js:126`).

# arch.
#
# **Four `data-*` attributes, and the last one is load-bearing.** A real image
# that has been focused in the website editor's image tools and then saved
# carries all four: `loadImageInfo` sets `originalId`, `originalSrc` and
# `mimetypeBeforeConversion` together from `/web_editor/get_image_info`, and
# `mimetype` if it is not already there (`image_processing.js:528-535`). The
# fixture carries them because of what the *first* line of that function does:
#
#     if ((img.dataset.originalSrc && img.dataset.mimetypeBeforeConversion) || !src) return;
#
# Without `data-mimetype-before-conversion` the function does not early-return,
# and under Ingress it would re-fetch the image info and **overwrite**
# `data-original-src` with the root-relative value the ORM just handed back --
# so the branch would compare two unprefixed values and pass whether or not
# rule 2 shipped. With it, the prefixed attribute the page HTML delivered is
# what the dialog reads, which is the whole measurement.
#
# `%(src)s` is the attachment's own `image_src`, read back from the server
# rather than built here, because it is the comparison's right-hand operand.

# spends them between the operator's Ctrl+C and the only restore a real
# `ir.actions.act_window.help` is going to get (#280).
#
# They are two numbers because they wait for different things, and the second one
# waits for far more than the first. The click needs nothing but an actionable
# button, which was matched `visible=true` in the same breath. The indicator
# clearing afterwards does **not** wait on a reload -- `_discard`
# (`web/static/src/model/relational_model/record.js:565`) is purely local, it
# resets `_changes` from the save point and re-renders, with no RPC at all. What
# it waits on is the line above it: `discard()` (`:183`) does
# `await this.model._askChanges()` first, which raises `NEED_LOCAL_CHANGES`, and
# the html field answers that by pushing `commitChanges()` into the promise list
# (`html_editor/static/src/fields/html_field.js:78`). On the mail designer that
# is `MassMailingHtmlField.commitChanges`, which runs `cleanForSave`, clones the
# editable into an `srcdoc` iframe, **awaits that iframe's `load`** ("Wait for
# the css and images to be loaded"), runs `toInline` over it and writes the
# result back into the record
# (`mass_mailing/static/src/js/mass_mailing_html_field.js:147-186`). So a discard
# on the designer pays the whole inlining pipeline before the indicator can
# clear -- the same pipeline the save path budgets `side.settle(6000)` for, and
# `extra["save_incomplete"]` exists because that is sometimes still not enough.
# A 5 s bound here therefore recorded `discarded: false` -- "the form was left
# dirty" -- for a discard that did come off, which is the misreading this issue
# exists to remove, arriving from the other side (#288). Hence 15 s: comfortably
# past the measured pipeline and still half of Playwright's default.
#
# **These two bounds are now the whole of what the seam spends** (#288). They
# were not: the window also held an unbounded-in-practice resolve -- `side.root`
# re-entering `_find_frame(wait_s=60)` whenever the Ingress frame reported
# detached, which is the interrupt scenario itself -- and a `side.settle(2000)`
# after the confirmation, worth about 10 s on every successful discard because
# `Side.settle` runs an 8 s `networkidle` that Odoo's open bus makes time out
# before it sleeps. The resolve is now `side.root_now`, which hands back the held
# frame and never enters that search, and the settle is gone: nothing any caller
# does after this seam touches a page or a frame. So these two are now the only
# waits the seam asks for: `<= 2 s` + `<= 15 s`, and about **nothing** when the
# discard comes off at once. Not a bound on the seam in every case, and this
# comment will not imply one again: the two `count()` calls take no `timeout=`
# because `count()` does not wait for anything, but they do need the renderer to
# answer, so on one of the conditions this function reports `false` for -- "a page
# that stopped responding" -- nothing here is bounded. Nothing bounded it before

    # cost was real and in the worst place: `Side.settle` runs an 8 s
    # `networkidle` that Odoo's open bus makes time out and *then* sleeps, about
    # 10 s on every successful discard, all of it between an operator's Ctrl+C

    # `_askChanges`, which resolves `this.mutex.getUnlockedDef()` as well as the
    # field commits (`relational_model.js:209-213`), so anything that went
    # through `model.mutex` has landed before the indicator can clear -- and
    # `beforeVisibilityChange`, the ungated `visibilitychange` save of #263, is
    # `root.save()` (`form_controller.js:483-496`), which does
    # (`record.js:226-229`). The one that is not is `urgentSave`: it calls
    # `_save` **outside** the mutex (`record.js:267-272`), so
    # `getUnlockedDef()` returns straight past it. But it is wired to
    # `beforeunload` only (`form_controller.js:507`), and the form view sets

    Four ways to one, and `borrow` decides whether the third is open:

    - **`--mailing-id` named one** (`given`): reuse it, do not look, do not
      create, do not delete -- and do not second-guess its state, because the
      operator chose the row.
    - **this driver's own scratch row is on the database** (`reclaimed`): named
      with `SCRATCH_NAME_PREFIX` by an earlier surface or an earlier run that ran
      without `--cleanup`. It is **reclaimed** and not borrowed, because reading
      it as borrowed would restore *this run's own* fixture body while recording
      `body_restored: true` -- evidence saying a real campaign was put back when
      nothing was -- and would make the row permanent, since every later run
      would read it the same way and no `--cleanup` would ever delete it.
    - **a real draft or queued mailing is on the database** (`found`): borrowed,
      and only by a check that asks to. Its body is written back and the row is
      never deleted, because #266's lesson is that a check which deletes what it
      did not create is how the next run ends up with nothing to measure.
    - **nothing is** (`created`): build one (#274) and delete it under
      `--cleanup`.

    **`borrow` is the whole difference between this module's two mailing checks,
    and it is not a style choice.** `media-document-mailing` never saves -- it
    *discards* the form and reads the record back to prove it -- so the only
    write a borrowed row takes is a `body_arch` the same run writes back.
    `mailing-editable` types in the designer and **clicks save**, because #238's
    subject *is* the save seam, and it therefore stores this run's marker body in
    both `body_arch` and `body_html` -- the field that leaves the installation
    with the mail. A run killed between the save and the restore, or taken
    without the optional `--cleanup`, would leave a real campaign holding it. So
    that check passes `borrow=False` and loses nothing by it: the designer,
    `getEditingValue` and `commitChanges` do not care which record they are on

    There is no view option for this path and none exists to set.

    is reached, which is why this check seeds one.

    **Not on `project.task.description`, which is the field #237's row names.**
    That field is `sanitize_tags=True`, so the ORM strips `<html>`, `<head>` and
    `<style>` on write: a full-HTML value seeded there comes back as the bare
    `<img>`, `computeContainsComplexHTML()` never sees a `<head>`, and the field
    renders the plain path -- which is check 1's screen, measured twice. Measured
    on this host: the seeded value read back as
    `<img src="/project_todo/static/img/todo_access.png">` and

    `HtmlField`. It is the field #240's row warns is "the value most likely to be
    full HTML" for exactly this reason. A scratch template is created and deleted

    there -- and leaves `body_html` empty, so rule 8 is the only thing in this

    "Present after the save" is not that reading though, and #279 is where the

    withheld on, the one `--mailing-id` named, a marker already in the field
    leaves this `false` whichever way the save went. That is the direction to fail
    in for a reading whose whole job is to refuse a false pass --
    `stored_verdict(False)` is `CLEAN`, so "inlined" is the claim that needs the

    """#239 line 3, on the one editor that has a control for it.

    `media-document-todo` records the current editor as unreachable, and it is
    right: Replace is namespaced to `image`, a document is an `a.o_image`, and
    `html_editor` does not even produce one any more -- its document selector
    renders a `span.o_file_box` whose whole subtree suppresses the toolbar. The
    **legacy** dialog is the other half of the sentence, and it is the one the
    mail designer opens.

    **The control is there, and the fixture decides whether it is usable.**
    `#media-replace` is un-hidden for anything matching
    `img, .fa, .o_image, .media_iframe_video` -- `.o_image` included, and it is
    the one case the snippets sidebar does not steal the button from, because
    that only happens for an `img`. But twelve lines further on the same
    function hides the whole toolbar for a media whose `data-mimetype` is not an
    image, and the dialog's own `createElements` always stamps `data-mimetype`
    on a document. So on a faithful fixture -- which is what this check builds,
    the anchor spelled exactly as the dialog writes one -- the toolbar is hidden
    and `#media-replace` is **not** the way in. A double-click is: it is bound
    on the same selector, it has no mimetype guard, and it calls
    `openMediaDialog` with the anchor. Both are tried and which one worked is
    recorded, because "the control that was looked for" is half of what #266
    asks of this line.

    **It is still a no-change check.** Both operands of the comparison arrive
    prefixed -- the element's `href` by the Runtime shim's `setAttribute`
    wrapper and by `IN`, and the literal `` `/web/content/${attachment.id}` ``
    by one of the generic literal rules the asset location has shipped since
    #166, because it begins `` `/web/ ``. No `OUT` was shipped for it and a
    Static-tier test refuses one. So a tile **not** highlighted here is new
    information, and is reported against #239 rather than recorded as a partial
    fix.

    **Nothing is meant to be saved, and three different things carry that
    rather than the sentence.** Clicking inside the designer's editable can
    leave the form dirty, and an Odoo form persists a dirty editor on
    `beforeunload` and on `visibilitychange` without the record being dirty at
    all (#263 is the same mechanism on the To-do form). So: the form is
    **discarded** whenever it shows unsaved changes, which is what stops the
    save; `body_arch` and `body_html` are **read back** into `stored`, where
    `stored_verdict` judges them, so a prefixed `href` that reached the record
    *during* the check fails it; and because this read-back happens before
    `run_check` closes the session, a save that a `beforeunload` on that close
    would make is outside it and is covered by the host reading the evidence
    takes afterwards. Saying which of the three answers which window is the
    point -- a read-back alone would not have covered the close.

    **It builds its mailing too, and the two outcomes are not the same** (#274).
    This was the one member of the family that still *looked up* a record it
    needed -- `odoo_parity` happens to carry a draft mailing, so every recorded
    run found one, and the gap appeared the moment the check was pointed
    anywhere else: #271's run, on a `catchup164b` where `mass_mailing` had been
    installed minutes earlier, got `NOT-RUN` and had to seed a mailing by hand
    over `odoo shell`. A mailing this check **made** is named after the run,
    recorded in `extra["fixture"]` beside the attachment, and **deleted** under
    `--cleanup`; a mailing it **borrowed** has both fields written back and is
    never deleted, because #266's lesson is that a check which deletes what it
    did not create is how the next run ends up with nothing to measure.
    `--mailing-id` keeps its meaning: reuse this one, do not create, do not
    delete. A scratch mailing an earlier surface or run left behind is
    **reclaimed** rather than borrowed, so it does not become permanent litter
    no `--cleanup` can reach.

    `--cleanup` removes what this run made and restores what it borrowed.

    The mailing comes from `fixture_mailing`, which holds the four ways to one
    and what each makes `--cleanup` answerable for. This check passes
    `borrow=True`: it never saves -- it discards the form and reads the record
    back to prove it -- so the only write a borrowed row takes is a `body_arch`
    this same run writes back, and borrowing is what keeps the check measuring
    the screen an operator's own mailing renders. `mailing-editable` answers the
    same question the other way, and `fixture_mailing` says why (#276).

    Everything after the first `create` is guarded, as in `seed_media_task` and
    `seed_website_fixture_page`: `run_check` discards a handler's return value
    when it raises, so a step failing in here would otherwise leave a public
    `ir.attachment` -- and now a mailing beside it -- on the host with nothing in
    the evidence naming them. The restore is in that path too, because the body
    write is the last step and a borrowed row must not keep this run's body just
    because the step after it failed.

    **The screen is the same whichever way the mailing arrived**, which is what
    makes a created one measurable rather than merely present. The designer's

    mailing and the editable -- is appended only when
    `value === "" || value === blankEditable`
    (`mass_mailing_html_field.js:520-534`), and the value it reads is the
    `body_arch` this seeder has already written: an `.o_layout` div in all three
