"""Runtime adapter for the read-only menu/action crawler, and its two-surface diff.

`crawl` opens every menu action of the chosen apps on one surface, up to
`MAX_TRAVERSAL_DEPTH`, and writes one `odoo-parity-evidence/v1` JSONL record
per action: the five signals of the parity plan section 7 step 5 and every URL
literal on the screen (`U-C5`). `open` writes the same record for screens
`crawl` cannot reach -- a module with no menu of its own, or one whose only
menu runs a server action -- named one by one in a target file. `diff` joins a
Public origin run and an Ingress run by control identity and gives each
`PARITY` or `GAP`; it judges an `open` run exactly as it judges a crawl.

The adapter only reads, with one named exception. It fetches the menu tree
with one GET and then navigates to each action's route; it never clicks, types
into Odoo records or calls an RPC, and a menu whose action could write (a
server action) is listed as skipped, never planned. The exception is an `open`
target that asks for a cart: reaching the website checkout needs one, so
`SurfaceDriver.ensure_cart` adds a product to the logged-in user's cart when it
is empty, and the record names the `sale.order` that made. That write is
outside the crawler's `OperationPolicy` on purpose -- see `ensure_cart` -- and
`require_write_database`
keeps it on the one database ADR 0012 allows it on.

Navigating writes too where Odoo writes on a plain GET: the checkout routes
edit the draft order while rendering it. `GET_WRITING_ROUTES` names those
routes and `require_write_database` holds them to the same database, so a
target reaches one only on a run allowed to write -- whether or not it declared
a cart.

Credentials come from the environment only:

  ODOO_TEST_LOGIN, ODOO_TEST_PASSWORD   both surfaces
  ODOO_PUBLIC_URL                       --surface public
  HA_BASE_URL, HA_TOKEN, ADDON_SLUG     --surface ha_ingress (HA_TOKEN is a
                                        long-lived access token)
  ODOO_DB, PARITY_TARGET, IGNORE_HTTPS_ERRORS   optional
  HA_BASE_URL on a public run                   optional; set it so a URL
                                        literal pointing at Home Assistant
                                        counts as a U-C5 violation

The Ingress session comes from the websocket `supervisor/api` route; the HTTP
`/api/hassio/...` proxy refuses long-lived tokens. The run then opens the
Ingress prefix as a top-level page with that session cookie.

The pure parts are tested in the static tier by test_e2e_menu_action_adapter.py.

# `ensure_cart` refuses the explicit write, `require_write_database` refuses a
# target file that asks for one -- so a target naming such a route sailed past
# both. The target list is the seam: the route is known before the first page
# is opened, and the enum cannot help (`NON_MUTATING_OPERATIONS` is every
# member of `Operation`, so nothing named there is ever refused).
#
# A key is a route prefix: it bounds the route itself and everything under it,
# so `/shop/change_pricelist` covers the `/shop/change_pricelist/<id>` the route
# is actually spelled as, and a route under a prefix needs its own key only when
# its write is not the one the prefix cites -- `/shop/payment/validate` has one
# for that reason, and the longest key is the one a refusal names. A key that
# ends in a slash bounds only what is *under* it and not the path itself, which
# is how `/my/orders/<id>` is bounded while the `/my/orders` list page, which
# writes nothing and is a parity path of its own, stays open. The value
# cites the write in upstream Odoo at the version odoo18ce/Dockerfile pins --
# 18.0.20260930, `ODOO_DEB_VERSION` -- read from that `.deb` under
# `usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/odoo/addons/`; a path with no module in front
# of it is under `website_sale/`, the one module audited route by route.
#
# That audit covers every `type='http'` route of `website_sale` the navigation
# itself can reach -- every `@route` of `controllers/`, including the bare
# `@route()` overrides of `website`'s own routes, whose route is the parent's:
# one not listed here is either unreachable by that navigation
# (`methods=['POST']`, `type='json'`) or its body was read and writes nothing --
# nothing but `request.session` (`/shop`), or nothing at all (`/shop/<product>`,
# `/shop/<product>/document/<id>`, `/shop/confirmation`, `/shop/print`,
# `/shop/product/<id>`). The body is what
# was read, not the `readonly=True` flag two of them carry: that flag is not a
# bound, because `odoo/http.py:2157-2168` rolls a read-only transaction back and
# re-runs the handler on a read/write cursor, so a `readonly` route that writes
# writes anyway.
#
# Three limits on what that buys, none of them something a list keyed on the
# target's route can see. The controller is not the whole request:
# `views/templates.xml:13` calls `website.sale_get_order()` from the cart link of
# every page header, which writes the same way `/shop/checkout` does
# (models/website.py:457), so a page whose controller writes nothing can still
# write. The target's GET is not the whole navigation: the page's own JavaScript
# posts on its own account, and `/shop/products/recently_viewed_update`
# (controllers/main.py:2288) writes a `website.visitor` from a product page
# nobody asked to write. And the route navigated is not always the route
# answered: `page.goto` follows a 30x, so a route that redirects into a listed
# one writes behind the guard -- no `website_sale` route does (the set is closed
# under its own redirects), which is a property of today's Odoo and not of this
# list.
#
# One write outside the list was read and left outside it:
# `website/models/ir_http.py:188-205` creates or touches a `website.visitor` on
# a GET whose response is a tracked page, whichever module serves it. It is out
# because it is not a property of the route: the gate is `view.track` on the
# template the response happened to render (`response_template` in its
# `qcontext`), so the same route can write on one website and not on another, and
# no list keyed on a route can say which. Bounding it would mean bounding every
# website page an `open` target can name -- `/`, `/contactus`, `/shop` -- which
# is a decision about whether `open` may judge a website page off
# `WRITE_DATABASE` at all, and that is the read-only guarantee as a whole and not
# this seam. (`crawl` is not affected either way: it navigates only
# `/odoo/action-<id>`, whose response is the web client bootstrap and not a
# tracked page, so it never makes this write.)
#
# And the list is not a complete audit of every Odoo module: `website_sale` was
# audited route by route, and the one `sale` route below is the one `sale` route
# that was read, not a finding that `sale`'s portal holds no others. A known
# write belongs on the list whatever module holds it -- an entry bounds it, and
# leaving it off to keep the list tidy would leave the hole this Issue is about

    A prefix matches the route itself and anything below it, on a path segment
    boundary: `/shop/payment/validate` is under `/shop/payment`, and a route
    that merely starts with the same characters (`/shop/cartons`) is not. A
    prefix that ends in a slash matches only what is below it, so `/my/orders/`
    bounds `/my/orders/7` and leaves `/my/orders` alone. The longest match wins,
    so adding a narrower entry under a wider one reports the narrower one rather
    than whichever the dict happens to hold first. The query is ignored -- it
    cannot make a writing route a reading one.

    A route that is not an absolute path is refused rather than answered.
    `parse_targets` refuses one too, so reaching this is a caller that skipped
    it, and a guard that cannot read the route must not say it is safe.

    The path is compared as Odoo routes it, not as it was typed, three ways.
    Percent-escapes and repeated slashes: `normalize_route` keeps both on purpose
    because they can route differently, and werkzeug unquotes before matching, so
    `/shop/%63heckout` reaches `/shop/checkout`. Dot segments and backslashes: the
    browser resolves the first and folds the second to `/` before it asks, so
    `/shop/x/../checkout` and `/shop\\checkout` both ask for `/shop/checkout` --
    `normalize_route` refuses both outright (`_safe_path`), so only a target
    nobody parsed brings one here, which is the caller this helper cannot rely
    on. And the language segment: Odoo's frontend
    takes the first segment of a path it cannot route as a language code and
    routes what is left (`http_routing/models/ir_http.py:390-392` at the pinned
    Odoo), which makes `/zh_TW/shop/checkout` the ordinary spelling of the
    checkout on a multilingual site. Every one of them can only refuse more than
    the literal spelling would, which is the safe direction for a guard.

        An empty cart gets one product; a cart that already holds something is
        left exactly as it is. Both surfaces share the user, so the second run
        must not add a second line: the two runs would then judge two carts of
        different sizes, and a difference in the page's own content would read
        as a difference between the surfaces.

        Refuses to write unless the session is on `WRITE_DATABASE`, the bound
        on this write, whoever the caller is.

        The line it adds carries no run marker, unlike the fixtures the Live
        scripts create: the cart is the logged-in user's own draft order and
        both surfaces have to judge the same one, so naming it after the run
        would edit the very screen under judgement. The record names the
        order and its size instead, and it carries the run id.

        The click is bounded but not quick: with every wait in it timing out,
        one cart target costs about twelve minutes -- two passes of a `load`
        navigation, the button waits, the badge wait and the cart readings,
        including the ones that confirm a two-click cart settled -- against
        about four before the retry existed. A run that sizes a timeout around
        this step should size it for that, and the loop refreshes the ingress
        session as it goes so the window does not lapse inside it.

        This writes, and is deliberately not an `Operation`:
        `NON_MUTATING_OPERATIONS` is every member of that enum, so a WRITE
        member added there would be *permitted* by `READ_ONLY_POLICY` rather
        than refused, and the read-only guarantee would quietly weaken. The

        False when it found nothing to click for: the badge on the page this
        navigation just rendered already shows a cart with something in it, so
        an add landed while it was loading and clicking would add the quantity
        twice. A badge on a page other than the cart can be a step behind, so a
        low reading proves nothing and is not trusted -- a reading above zero is
        the cart saying it is not empty, and that is all this asks of it.

        A click comes back as `"answered"` -- its POST to a cart route drew an
        answer, which is what says the add committed -- or `"unanswered"`: no
        such answer inside the wait's bound, so the caller still has the badge
        and the cart reading to consult. Both are true, the way the old bool
        was; only False means nothing was clicked.

        `domcontentloaded` is when the button exists, not when it works: the
        handler is attached by the website bundle, which is still loading then,
        so a click at that moment can land on a dead element and the cart never
        grows. This navigation waits for `load` instead -- every bundle script
        fetched and run, which is the closest thing to "the handlers are on"
        Playwright can wait for. `networkidle` would wait for more than that and
        for things that never settle; the button's own state is the rest.

        Being visible is attached and laid out where a click reaches it. Being
        enabled is worth asking of the `button` some themes render; on the
        `<a class="a-submit">` Odoo's own template renders there is nothing to
        disable and Playwright always answers yes. Neither says the listener is
        attached, which nothing can, and that is why the caller clicks again on
        a cart that stayed empty rather than failing the run on the first miss.
