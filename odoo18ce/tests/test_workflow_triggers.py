"""Static-tier contract on the two Live-tier workflows' triggers (ADR 0005).

The Perimeter check and the Literal rewrite gate lost their nightly schedule
when the add-on took both jobs inside the container: the start-time
self-check for the perimeter, the Rewrite scan for the Literal rewrite. Both
workflows stay runnable by hand for whenever a Public origin exists again.

The test host that served as the control group was reinstalled for another
purpose (#314; ADR 0003, postscript 2026-10-27), so nothing dispatches the
perimeter check any more: release.yml used to run it after every Release, and
with no Public origin left each run failed and sent an email.
